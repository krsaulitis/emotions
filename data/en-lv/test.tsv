Excuse me?	27	ef5wsk1

but you won't hear that from most of the press or people on this sub WHAT IS THEIR POLICY THOUGH lmao	1	eeorxwd
A friend calls this shadow work. I think you're right. It takes a lot of courage and persistence.	4	edzwslf
You know it’s bad when you grab the toothpaste and start reading it	3	edqjvo0
Who was it? I got here after it was deleted, and I'd like to read the comment history.	7	edcm3cr
On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.	22	eduxkh8
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.	26	eetrfd1
And then everyone clapped	27	eex08xg
I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.	23	efafosi
Thanks for the P.S	15	efbnv71
This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.	7,24	ed2qpz3
Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!	7,12	ed219du

Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it and I hope you're doing better now!	0,15	edk6w8j
That dad must love monster high as well.	18	eddktov
I’m curious what is their concern and their purpose to be plus-size people influencers regarding the fact that they do not belong to that group?	27	eect4wn
Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch	3,27	ef4vuyy
Also them dealing with mean and petty people especially in school	27	eda3seg
"Okay. I mean 18% of the words in the comment you replied to were ""Times"", but okay"	27	eex2z2r
Street Samurai Koji and Ojiisan Koji are my personal favorites. Greased Lightning Koji is pretty fun as well.	18	ee9jvfx
THIS!!	13	eerr82c
That was my mistake. It should only show your First Name and The 1st letter of my last name.	24	ee7toae
Hasn’t hurt me none	10	efag0ql
They never seem to think this when the police arrive, with their guns, to end a terrible situation. 	27	edwyapx
Honestly, if you did not, then you were watching the video incorrectly.	10	edi4u1a
This is why I love politics. It really shows how stupid people are.	18	ef64yoh
Good point, thank you for the correction	15	eegfgs5

Most non immigrants won't do farm work for peanuts either	27	ed8yx1p
Shaming men for trying to solve a problem on their own is actually an example of toxic femininity	27	eeutvg2
Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on. 	25	edk6gbr
It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.	3	eejj57x
Downvote. These slippers cute as hell.	27	eevg200
Ah fair enough. Thanks for elaborating	15	edn65tb
Tough times don't last tough people do... Die'n is easy, living isn't, make the best of it	4	ee4kmno

You played torb....... that’s why. Just kidding that’s really weird though	10	efe8j5d
So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.	2	ee92had
Yes, I’m sure [NAME] biggest concern is New Japan getting criticism on Reddit.	4	eeu5mfp
Why do you keep going back the them? Why should care about hillbillies?	6	eeetsyl
The first sentence alone sums it all up 😂	4	ef2hcbw
He was only thrown in there so we could have [NAME] get heroically saved by him and so we would hate [NAME]	27	efag9qk
EDIT: wrong link sorry here’s the right one I hope	24	efdhrfd

Fuck [NAME] pai	2	eep6w1l
I literally got the same bug	9	eegfjlp
I agree with your guy. Sex can sometimes improve with the adulterous partner, because he/she feels desired and sexy again.	4	efdwddq
Someone get us a [NAME] version of the [NAME] nice lead meme!!!	8	ee8yy8w
He’s probably just getting stressed out that it is now getting dark and he lives in the countryside	27	edhgiy7
That’s an insult!! To fecal matter.	9	ee63efc
Chicken and the egg argument. Gun companies don't donate to [NAME] *because* they have gun control on their platform. This goes back decades mind you.	27	eduge0v
I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.	5,18	edk3huj
People on Reddit barely know anything about law but they love to get riled up about the little that they do know	18	ed2uyol
I admit I’ll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.	4,17	ednculf
Any rap song because I hate it	2	ed2hvlf
BERNIE OR BUST	27	eezvpdn
Before the trade happened I knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] beauty had not reached me yet	9	eeqmptc
That’s horrible. What country? If you don’t mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.	14	efh50bc
I thought they held hands while they and [NAME] were watching TV ([NAME] was pretending to be sick in that episode)?	27	ef2u519
I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.	26	ed3mf1l
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.	3,11	efgt3q2
Ok, thank you and thanks for the LPT. Cold leftover food is great sometimes like cold pizza, cold meatballs, etc...	15	ed27iy5
What's up with all the gloating.	7	edyb804
[NAME] x [NAME] sounds cute for some reason.	0	eduuk6t
Thanks, now every highlander I run into tries to do it 100% of the time and I just bait them into a light parry	15	edh94dx
I know man, however in some ways it's a good way to act out a martyr complex. 	4	edixbsb
> punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...	2	edbyvi1
Weird, I checked again and it works for me now. It wasn't the first few times I tried to click.	27	edt9956
Thank you for the detailed response. It’s about time I worry about making myself happy rather than them.	15	ed41m72

So you’re telling me [NAME] hasn’t got a baby face?	27	ed8jisf
[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too	10	ef12vk6
Sending you some Ramona wine as thanks!	15	efgjczx

To be fair, I will also continue to jerk off to pictures of [NAME] in shorts He looks so good in them	0,4	edlk1zx

Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.	10	ee52iny
Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!	0	ef9ibsj
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.	2	edm9lwz

Please dont put words into my mouth.I never said rape isnt a problem.	3	efa80q4

 Now, can you make another applet to change his wallpaper?	27	eer0hlf
I did and found it basically the same except I was getting drunk very easily.	4	eeuer5u
Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.	27	eepf1aq
Thanks, I love it.	15,18	edgkwiy
Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.	3,9	eevggs1
Highgate Hill! Close to westend and has a lot of cute houses. :)	27	edtbcto

"BT In the commentary booth: ""Where's your god [NAME]?"" As she's being mauled by a lion"	26,27	eetgibp
It’s a facepalm just for the wrong reason	9,27	eebf1m4
"Because there's such a thing as ""too good to be true"" and some people are still skeptical of that."	27	edw65t1
He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.	27	edw5iqn
Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.	9,25	eem6ixj

Paradokss nedarbojas, tad arī tiesību iekasēšana joprojām ir zagšana.	27
Jā viņš izdarīja.	4,27
&gt;ja tava mašīna ir tik lieliska, kāpēc tev tā visu laiku jālej ar benzīnu Lūk, cik stulbi tu izklausies	3
ES nezinu. Izteikti komplimenti meiteņu pasaulē ir kā profesionālais sports.	27
Nav pietiekami skumji, jo skelets ir miris, tāpēc viņš nevar izdarīt pašnāvību	27
Labi darīts čalis! Nopietni :) Bet tā turpināt, nezaudējiet šo impulsu.	0
kurš tf ir vidējais puisis? Ir paredzēts, ka lietotājam [NAME] ir saulesbrilles un klauna automašīna, piemēram, FE6	27
*holy shit* Esmu diezgan pārliecināts, ka pantera domāja to pašu	27
Pagaidiet, jūs neticat, ka viņš ir nekļūdīgs? Lūdzu, miniet svarīgu gadījumu, kad viņš ir kļūdījies, lai to pierādītu.	27
Tāpat ļaut sportistiem nākt trenēties gada laikā, bet piešķirt aptumšošanas periodu pirms olimpiskajām spēlēm vai tamlīdzīgi,	27
Manā pulkstenī nevar vienkārši nozagt nieres	27
Mums ir jāparāda vēl viens mērķis. Nāciet puiši.	27
*10 minūšu neveikla lomu spēle*	12
ES mīlu tavu brāli.	18
Ak tāpēc, ka visus augļaugus ir izaudzējuši cilvēki, ok TIL	27
Tas ir šeit katru dienu. Karmas prostitūtas vai ne?	3
Tā ir problēma, jo šo šķietamo kaulu fragmentu kastīti burtiski varēja atrast jebkur.	27
Diezgan sūdi tbh ar tevi	11
tas ir pārsteidzoši!! Apsveicu!	0,17
KAPTEINIS!! jā-jā? SKATIES!!!	27
Es sagriezu potīti, mēģinot to spēlēt DDR.	25
Es patiešām domāju, ka tas būtu ikonisks kadrs, ja tas būtu slavenā šausmu filmā. Tas, kā kājas turpina nākt, ir biedējoši.	14
Nevis žurnālisti...mediju aktīvisti.	27
Es noliedzu tikai to, kas nav patiesība, un tas, ka [NAME] ir mans vārds, nav patiess.	9
Es zinu, ka par to tika runāts, bet tas ir apšaubāmi :(	6
Kā Kentuki štata fans esmu skatījies [NAME] visu gadu, un viņš ir likumīgs. Vienkārši vēlos, lai būtu scenārijs, ka GB varētu viņu paņemt.	27
Skumji ir tas, ka šīs mēmes ir vairāk Z paaudzes, ja kas...	25
&gt; tas neliks viņai izskatīties pēc idiotes Būtu grūti likt viņai izskatīties vairāk pēc idiotes, nekā viņa to jau dara.	2
Man tā notiek daudz. Es arī dziedāšu vienu un to pašu frāzi atkal un atkal.	27
Pēc manas pieredzes tas vienmēr [NAME] ir mans	27
“Jums nav ne jausmas, kas ir fašisms” Turpinās popularizēt burtiskā genocīda taktiku. Tu esi nicināms	2,11
Skaidrs, ka nav pietiekami labi	10
Ja visi noliktu kameru, lai palīdzētu, ko jūs darītu šobrīd?	7
No [NAME]: IT &#39; SSPELLEDOUIJA Ardievu	27
Ak, tas ir satricinājums	14
Nē es vēlos. Viņi ne pārāk bieži ierodas Teksasā.	8
es apzinos. es mēģinu saprast, kā jūs to atradāt tajā, ko es teicu. pat pēc situācijas konteksta.	22,27
Ak! Tas sāpināja ego. Un tas nav viegli izdarāms.	9
Jā, bez mūzikas šī aina būtu daudz sliktāka.	11
Interesanti. Es arī tā domāju. Esmu tikai pateicīgs, ka man ir cits pagasts, uz kuru varu viegli braukt uz misi. Vēlreiz paldies	15
Godīgi sakot, piekrītu. Mums ir jāizvairās no veģetāriešiem neatkarīgi no lietas [NAME]. /s	4
Paldies! Es beidzu piešķirt dbq un pārī studentus uz augšu	15
Aizsardzības kļūdu kombinācija un Sabres dieva šausmīgā PP sāga.	11
Man žēl, ka tu aizrāvies ar karniju, brāl.	24
Lol, nejaucies ar [NAME]!	1,3
Es vienmēr esmu vēlējies kādu no tiem, bet tāpat kā uztraukumam tas manā veļasmašīnā radīs milzīgu nekārtību	8,20
[NAME] TU SLIME	27
Jums tas nav jāskatās, ja nevēlaties. Neviens netur ieroci tev pie galvas.	27
Es ēdu savu mammu un tēti	27
Es esmu to fans savvaļā, zebiekstes ir interesantas. Ne kā mājdzīvnieki, nē.	0
Tas ir biedējoši un tik ļoti skumji. Vienpadsmit??? Mazulis! Es joprojām cēlu fortus. Es raudu par šo bērnu.	14,25
Pie velna? Tā ir iespēja viena no miljona! Vienīgais, kas to padarītu trakāku, ir, ja mēs atrodamies vienā pilsētā, lol	1
Svētais bez pieturzīmēm, [NAME]!	27
MeToo mērķis ir dalīties ar personīgiem stāstiem par seksuālu vardarbību. Pārfrāzēt to kā apsūdzību un kā nolaupīšanas veicināšanu ir sasodīti pretīgi.	11
Ja [NAME] tiek uzskatīts par visu aizsardzību, arī [NAME] ir vajadzīga lielāka mīlestība	5
Jā, jo nav tā, ka olas kādreiz apgāztos vai kas cits. /s	27
Man ir ļoti jauks tempurpēdiskais un apmēram 6 karaļa izmēra pūkaini, ko izmantoju, lai vienkārši aizmigtu apskaujoties.	0
Patiešām ir pārsteidzoši, cik vispārēji nepatīk [NAME] kā komentētājs sabiedrībā, taču viņš joprojām komentē praktiski katrā lielajā tuvcīņas turnīrā.	0
Šodien ir vienīgā diena, kad es patiešām ienīstu savu suņu pastaigu darbu	11
Šis žoklis izskatās bez laktozes. Iejauc sieru tajā žoklī.	27
Uz spēlēm, kas sākās 7, autobuss, manuprāt, izbrauca no viesnīcas ap 4:30.	27
No kā viņš tevi &quot;dziedināja&quot;?	7
Tagad es domāju, vai [NAME] dzer un vai viņš kādreiz ir bijis alkohola reibumā, veicot kādu no saviem darījumiem.	26
kas tas par aptauju	27
Un ups UN a yikes. Varbūt pat tik daudz kā OOF. Noteikti wow no manis	20,26
Tas jau ir publicēts šajā subredditā, bet paldies.	15
Esmu apjucis. Kur es kaut ko ierosināju? Es tikai aprakstu, kā lietas pašlaik darbojas un kas jāņem vērā...	6
Viņi NEKAD nesargā no tā!	27
Ļaujiet tai iet, skatieties nākotnē, nedzīvojiet pagātnē	5
&gt; tas veicina domu, ka indivīda balsij nav nozīmes. Tomēr indivīda balsij nav nozīmes. Tas ir tikai fakts.	27
Viņi nedomā par veidiem, kā izvairīties no tēmām un vairāk novirzīties, jo pēdējā laikā viņiem tas šķiet tik labi.	27
Tātad viņa zina 3 valodas. Interesanti, kas tās ir?	7,26
Es zinu, ka šī ir patiesība, starp mums, vīriešiem, ir neizteikta patiesība, mēs slepeni mīlam matainu vaj. Nē? Tikai es?	6
tikai tad, kad domā, ka sliktāk vairs nevar būt...	27
[NAME] nekad neko nedarīs, lai jums palīdzētu. Jums jāiestājas par sevi.	27
Tas ir bezgalīgs balto grāmatu skaits, kas uzrakstīts pēdējo 3/4 gadu laikā. Neviens no tiem nav bijis labs vai izmantots	9
Es tikai redzu divus uzpūstus pāvus ar mēmu un pretīgu skatienu sejā. Bet diemžēl es neesmu tas dzimums, kas viņus vērtē.	27
Ak, [NAME], tas atkal notiek!	26
209 komentāri un mēs nevaram izlasīt nevienu? Visi šie labie makaronu padomi tiks izniekoti. Kauns.	7,12
Es dodos svētajiem un priekšniekiem. Lai gan es domāju, ka Chiefs-Pats spēle varētu iet abos virzienos	22
Tātad skaidrs, ka jums ir plašas zināšanas par lineāro algebru, un vai jūs varat pārbaudīt visu dokumentu un to atspēkot?	7,27
Man patīk, ka spēlētāji beidzot iesaistās spēlē. Cilvēki jūtas ieguldīti! Man tas patīk!	18
Pagājušajā sezonā [NAME] jautāja, vai viņš ir bijis Filijas sporta rakstnieks. Viņa atbilde bija diezgan interesanta:	27
Pārliecība, kas šeit nozīmē pilnīgu bs, kas paredzētas, lai palīdzētu attaisnot šausmīgo favorītismu.	27
Ja reliģijas brīvība ir ierobežota, tad jums nav reliģijas brīvības. Sekulārisms ir reliģija un pārspēj citas reliģijas laicīgajās zemēs.	27
Neskatoties uz visu [NAME] naidu Melburnā, šeit ir skaista indiešu dziesma jums visiem	0
Kas šajā planētā ir skaists? Daba ir auksta, skarba un ciešanu un sāpju pilna. Vispār nekā skaista tajā nav.	3,7
Mūsu tēvs mūs pasargās &lt;3	5
Visi zina, ka labais [NAME] ir netīrais mazais velniņš	27
“Par brīvdienām” jūs jau sen esat bijis Amerikā, es domāju.	27
Šķiet, ka viņam ir bijusi šausmīga cilvēka vēsture:	11
Paldies par to. Šī apakšgrupa nav vērtējuma vai pašbildes apakšgrupa. Šajā ziņā burtiski nav poligrāfiska satura.	15
Es domāju, ka komandas joprojām pārgriezīs šķērsšuvi, kas pagājušajā gadā padarīja [NAME] un [NAME] tik nāvējošus. Tas tomēr ir lieliski.	0,20
Es domāju, ka viņiem tomēr izdevās pateikt [NAME].	27
Mazāk nekā pirms 75 gadiem maniem vecvecākiem pēc bēgšanas no Vācijas uz priekšējā zāliena Dienvidkarolīnā sadedzināja svastikas.	27
Redzot, kā es biju tīne un kāds ir vairums pusaudžu, nē! Negribas ar to nodarboties.	10
Es domāju, ka patiesais iemesls ir laba prese un alkohols	0
Tas ir joks.	1
Nē! Viņi joprojām turpat uz ietves! Burtiski absolūti nekādā veidā tiem apiet!	10
Laiks skrien skrien, kad esat pusprofesionāls citātu veidotājs. Interesanti, ko viņš šajās dienās dara.	26
Paldies !	15
Es šeit dzīvoju! Acīmredzot man jātur acis vaļā.	27
Man daudz labāk patīk, ja CB dod nogaršot viņu pašu zāles. Daudz vairāk gandarījuma nekā būt pieklājīgam. Šis ir lielisks!	0,4
Viņa ir šausmīga, un tas viss ir par viņu. Mēģini vēlreiz. Un, kad izrādei būs šausmīgi reitingi, tas tiks apstiprināts.	2,27
Claw kopš AW un pieteicies fuck tonnas stundas un bez diskomforta	27
Mazliet līdzīgi kā Dundee United, kurš mēģina neielaist 5 pret Ayr United.	27
Vēl nē! Bet es gaidu brīnumu katru gadu!	8,26
Un tad jūs esat iestrēdzis ar šīm zālēm uz mūžu, izklausās pēc biedējoša kompromisa.	14
Ja kāds ir ieinteresēts, es labprāt sadarbotos ar dažiem reddit cilvēkiem par NFL drafta izpēti, klasifikāciju un viltotiem draftiem.	8
Nu es dzirdēju padomu visiem noklausīties šo sēriju, tas bija ārkārtīgi interesanti.	0
Es vakar lejupielādēju šo albumu, un man tas patīk!	4,18
Paldies; ES mēģināju.	15
ES arī. Bet es dažreiz par to fantazēju.	8
Ahh, tātad tieši tajā pašā vietā, kur viņš bija pēdējo reizi. brīnišķīgi lol	1
Lūdzu, paskaidrojiet “Hoover/ed”. Nav pazīstams ar terminu. Paldies-	15
Iespējams, es zināju, ka šis zāliena krēsls ir slikta ideja.	10
Sagatavojieties kādai no šīm astes aizbāžņa lietām	27
Viņš dosies uz Bengals 11 gadu vecumā, un es to tik ļoti ienīstu	2
100 attiecību nodaļas + 50 nodaļas pēc tam, kad [NAME] pameta [NAME]. Sasodīts, Sasuga TT	27
Vai esat mēģinājuši iegūt bagātus vecākus?	27
Pirms visas BS lol	1
Pasmieties par viņiem visu, ko vēlaties; Fakts ir tāds, ka viņi uzvarēja regulārajā sezonā, kad mēs nevarējām.	1
Tajā brīdī [NAME] vairs nebija jaunava! Nē nopietni, pajautājiet [NAME]!	27
Es tik ļoti to daru!	13,27
Pazaudēju savu identitāti, domāju, vai esmu kļuvis ārprātīgs...	25,26
Izklausās labi.	0
[NAME].	27
Jo dažos gadījumos vecāki pamatā nolaupa savus bērnus un tur pret viņu gribu un piespiež piedalīties šajās programmās. Tā ir vardarbība pret bērniem.	3,11
Satraukums par jaunu regulējumu un nodokļiem ancap redditā?!?	6
Esmu paņēmis kreveles, kas ir lielākas nekā vairumam abortētu augļu. Es neredzu, ka policija klauvē pie manām durvīm par uzbrukumu cilvēkam.	27
Šodien atnāca arī mūsējie :). Mums ir 22 hbu?	27
Ja šis pavediens pārvērtīsies par tādu kā pēdējo, tas tiks bloķēts. Godīgs brīdinājums...	5
Laipni lūgts mājās!	15
[NAME], [NAME] uzsāk laulību ar neuzticību un dzēruma priekšlikumiem. Es ceru, ka viņam būs laimīga un ilga laulības dzīve.	5,8,20
Diezgan dīvaini, ka cilvēki jūs negatīvi vērtē, nesniedzot labi pamatotus pretargumentus jūsu izteiktajiem punktiem.	3
Es vēlos, lai tas būtu īsts, bet meitenēm, tāpēc man nav jājūt rūgtums, ka tieku noraidīts, jo &quot;Tu neesi mans veids&quot;.	8
Laipni lūdzam brīvības un demokrātijas cirkā, kas ir “mercuh”! 👍	13
[NAME] no HR atkal dzer.	27
Atkārtots mačs pret UVA, vai ne? Pirmais līdz 40 uzvarām!	7
Jā. Būtībā Sky Germany un Sky Sports vispār nav uzticami	10
ANO paziņoja, ka vēlēšanas bija viltus. Vīrietis izraisa nāves iznīcināšanu un badu. Jūsu morāle ir pilnīgi un galīgi fucked.	9,25
Jums vajadzētu veltīt laiku un doties pie ārsta.	5
Tas man tikai atgādināja, ka jāturpina veidot šo asiņaino vietni.	2
Tagad ir 7	27
Kad [NAME] sanikno savu meitu un sievu. Meita: “Tu vairs neesi mans tētis” [NAME]: “Tu vairs neesi mans tētis”	2,3
lol, kāpēc gan neizlasīt par Islandi un sazināties ar mani.	1
Man nav ticības, bet teodīcijas problēmai ir vairākas atbildes, mani tas pārāk neuztrauc.	27
Velns, tas nekas	26
Dīvaini, kad viena valsts tika iznīcināta, bet otra nē.	27
Ak dievs, vēl viena trauma	25
(*ﾉωﾉ) O-labi senpai OWO *Nuzzles* Frick off Es rakstu visu, ko gribu!	27
Paldies, ka dalījāties ar šo. Savu māju atradu 1938. gadā. Ļoti aizraujošas lietas :)	15
Diktors: &quot;Viņi to nedarīja&quot;	10
Paskaties visapkārt uuu. Visa daba liecina par radītāju un viņa mīlestību pret mums	27
Jā, tu egoiste.	2,3
[NAME] tik forši	0
Es vienmēr uzkrītu šim jokiem..	1,27
[NAME]?! Vai tas ir [NAME]? Es zinu, ka &quot;meegwetch&quot; nozīmē paldies, lol	1,6
man sāp sirds :( kāpēc tu mani pameti	25
Kura daļa no jūsu teiktā ir saistīta ar to, ko es teicu, izņemot klibu mēģinājumu būt apvainojošam?	3,6,7
Ne viens mans draugs	27
Jums vēlreiz jāpārbauda sava zinātne. Vienkārša Google meklēšana nodrošinās pētījumu rakstus, kas parāda LGBT bioloģisko un ģenētisko pamatu. Priecīgu lasīšanu!	17
[NAME] trenējies un noskaties dažas pamācības, pirms izdrāž franču šampanieša pudeli 100 $	3
Lai gan tas ir jauki, mēģiniet kritiski domāt, kamēr lasāt. Pierādi, ka tavs dievs eksistē — ļauj viņam mani sasist. Tas varenais sita.	27
jā, tu neienīsti pirmdienas, tu ienīsti kapitālismu.	27
Wowowow!!!! Es arī veicu kampaņu par [NAME]!	13,26
Bet viņi to nedarīja, jo tas ir viltots.	10,27
Priecīgu viņam kūku dienu	15,26
Tas tiek uzskatīts par problēmu, ja vienā dienā jums ir tik daudz	27
Man tas izklausās, ka viņš mēģina atrast vainu viņā, lai liktu sev justies labāk, viņu pametot.	27
Jā. Ignorēt un doties tālāk	4,5
Laimīgs? Īsti nē, bet priecājamies, ka varam nonākt pie secinājuma par manu neķītrās atbildes rakstu.	7,17
Tas neietilpst konkurētspējīgā apakšā; tam nav nekāda sakara ar spēles konkurences aspektu.	4,10
Naaah, tas ir un vienmēr būs [NAME], jo īpaši kopš viņas pārveidošanas MKX. ideāls waifu.	4
Lmfao lonzo? Tas puisis nav nba talants. Pasaule sasitīs tam dupsi	2
Patiesībā es ar viņu runāju. Jūs varat redzēt viņa atbildi man, es saiti uz to komentārā. Viņš mani sauca par sauszemes vali.	4,27
Vai man šķiet, ka [NAME] bija aizskarošais guru? Kāpēc viņam būtu jādabū izveidots puisis, kurš ir apvainojies?	27
Šai apakšgrupai nepatīk profesionālas sporta komandas, kamēr tās neuzvar čempionātā. Tad visi kļūst par die hard faniem.	0
Bija viens labs gads, un pēc tam pievienojas dieva komandai, kas cīnās, lai kvalificētos	17
Šķirieties un esiet stingrs. Jūs jau esat atzinis, ka esat negodīgs. Kāpēc vadīt viņu tālāk?	3,6,7
Tas izskatītos lieliski, ja [NAME] to pasūtītu!	27
Es nemaz neesmu šīs nomas piekritējs... Es arī neesmu fans par to, kā tas viss iznāca. Visapkārt slikti.	10
Tas ir absolūti pretīgi.	11
Nē, tas izskatās ļoti garšīgi	13
Neklausieties idiotā, mums patīk jūsu raksti!	5
Ha! Atgūt viņu atpakaļ ar viņa paša ķiparu!	27
Atveriet biļeti un gaidiet. Šīs nākamās divas nedēļas būs ļoti nozīmīgas. Viss, ko mēs varam darīt, ir gaidīt.	27
Es gribu redzēt šo filmu!!	27
Cilvēk, nekad nenovērtē par zemu katla, saldētas vistas, dārzeņu un biezpiena spēku.	4
Kur viņi bija? Es mēģināju viņus izsekot un nevarēju atcerēties, kur tos redzēju.	6
Baltajā mājā nav arī suņa. Kāpēc? Jo suņi var saost ēzeli jūdzes attālumā.	4
Žēl, ka esmu slikto ziņu nesējs.	24
Lmao Es ceru, ka es neesmu vienīgais, kurš to saņem	20
*skatās YouTube komentāru sadaļas* Hm. Es neesmu tik pārliecināts.	6
Šis vīrietis elpojot agresīvi ņurd	3
Mans puika [NAME] &lt;3	27
Oho! Tagad tā ir propaganda, ko mēs varētu izmantot vairāk!	13,20
Viņi atdalījās, jo [NAME] tika ievēlēts, neskatoties uz to, ka viņš nebija redzams nevienā vergu štatā. Kā tas ir kaut kas, izņemot ideoloģijas pārstāvību.	27
Jā! Mana lielā resna pasakainā dzīve	0
Autors domā, ka puisis, kurš lēca uz priekšu un atpakaļ starp sola lomu un AAA, atlec uz priekšu un atpakaļ starp sola lomu un AAA.	27
Ironiskā kārtā es tikai nojautu, ka viņi strādā jomā, kur šī ir gatava ieņēmumu plūsma, kas viņus tikai gaida.	27
Mana mamma kādreiz uzskatīja, ka [NAME] ir izskatīgākais NFL treneris.	0
Nē, ja kaut kas ir tieši pretējs. Nevarētu būt tālāk no patiesības	27
Atvainojos par jūsu tiesībām	24
Nu 1/2 jau ir izdarīts!	27
Es uzticos savai gaļai Safeway, nevis Great Canadian Superstore. Es zinu, ka šajā ziņā neesmu viens. Safeway piedāvā dažas diezgan labas, lētākas gaļas.	0
Es diemžēl palaidu garām šo daļu	9
Tirgus ≠ Kapitālisms Tas, ka kaut kas darbojas kapitālisma sistēmā, nepadara to par kapitālistisku. Tas, ka [NAME] tika (domājams) ievēlēts, nepadarīja viņu par demokrātisku	10
Ņem visas īpašības, labās un sliktās	27
Atvainojiet, bet šī ir stulba atbilde. Ofc tas bija viltus laipnība golly	24
Es hieaa es tikai paklupu, kā jūsu lds un nezinu vai šeit. Nevermo šeit reklāma dzird, kad es biju bērns	27
Jā, problēma bija pirms mēneša, bet pēc tam tā ir pazudusi	27
Ķīnas krāpšana pārējā pasaulē ir briesmīga ekonomikai un sabiedrībai.	10
&gt;tāda līmeņa atklāts rasisms Amerikā netiktu pieļauts arī Manas domas. Tāpēc man bija vajadzīgs konteksts, tas ir ĻOTI dīvaini.	8,27
Es par to neatvainojos. Es vienkārši nedomāju, ka jaunajā derībā ir kaut kas tik klaji amorāls.	3
Tik izskatīgs	0
Vai viņi ir miruši? Es neatceros šo Kristus dzimšanas lugas fragmentu.	7
Man ir neērti atzīt, ka biju satriekts, uzzinot, ka visām viņa grāmatām ir vienāds precīzs svars un ka jūs zināt, kāds ir šis svars...	12
Nav superbowl @ lambo šai paaudzei; cerams, ka globālā sasilšana atstās iespaidu nākamajos 30 gados. :)	4,8
Es zinu. Es taču neteicu, ka piekrītu, vai ne?	4,27
Vienīgais, kas aptur depresīvu puisi ar ieroci, ir fiziologs ar ieroci. &lt;&lt; [NAME]	22
Oho, 5 negatīvi vērtējumi 3 minūtēs. Ej tu!	26
Viss, ko es Ziemassvētkos vēlos, ir salauztas mājas	8
Nu es cenšos pilnveidoties, cilvēk	20
Liels paldies &lt;3	15
Es tikai gribu, lai tk būtu nejaušs švacis	8
Ļoti iespējams, taču nav nekādu pazīmju, ka pašlaik tiktu strādāts pie darījuma par [NAME] tirdzniecību. Mēs viņu ne tikai iemainīsim pret zemesriekstiem.	27
Piekrītu, ka jums ir nepieciešams vairāk laika vēlākajos pagriezienos. Taču lielākajā daļā spēļu šķiet, ka cilvēki gaida, kamēr pienāks viņu kārta, lai sāktu domāt.	4
Cerams, ka esat saglabājis šo vēstuli!	20
IEDEDZIET BĀKAS!	27
Vai es gribētu šobrīd būt muša uz tavas sienas un skatīties visu šo neveiksmi.	18
Kā jūs to zināt?	27
Ko, tavuprāt, dara sievietes? Arī es mastrubējot esmu kluss kā baznīcas pele	4
To viņi tomēr vēlas. Tātad, ja jūs patiešām vēlaties &quot;uzvarēt&quot; viņu cīņās, vienkārši ignorējiet tos :)	27
Viņš turpina to teikt manā spēlē, kad tas noteikti NAV tas, ko es daru. Es vienkārši sūcu medības!!	3
Viens stulbs, kurš nav skatījies, kā Hereditary sūdzas par bezjēdzīgām balvām internetā, nozīmē... eh. Es zaudēju savu punktu. Skatieties Herditary	2
Tas bija tik aizkustinoši ❤️❤️❤️	18
Vai viņš to ir darījis arī ar citiem pasaules līderiem? Vai tikai [NAME]?	7
Pagaidiet... suņi nevar izmantot kāpnes!	10
Tās ir tikai fucked lol runāt par lētu.	1
Par ko pie velna ir runa?	2
Varēja pamanīt, ka viņš bija nedaudz nervozs, manuprāt, tas bija galvenais iemesls, kāpēc viņš spēlēja šajā spēlē.	4
Es neapzinājos, ka tas notiek! Paldies! Pēc OPs fotoattēla bija grūti pateikt, kādas bija izmaiņas	15
Viņa tevi NEMīl. Mēģiniet pajautāt sev, kāpēc jūs pieņemat šo ārstēšanu.	5,10
Lol omg yesssss. Iespējams, labākais ieteikums, ko kāds man jebkad ir teicis 🙌🏼	0,1,4
Kas tev smird	27
Kāpēc lai es to darītu?	7
Vēl viena diena, kārtējais Newsweek raksts, kurā tiek ziņots par kāda komentētāja teikto televīzijā.	27
Liels paldies par padomu! Noteikti paturēs to prātā	15
Abonēju sjwstories, paldies, ka informējāt mani par šo!	15
Es domāju, vai tas tiešām varētu būt darba stress. Viņš strādā ilgas stundas prestižā advokātu birojā. Man vajag pieci viņam vairāk kredītu.	7
Man patīk šī sajūta	0,18
Uzticēties lasītājiem mūsdienās un mūsdienās nevaram atļauties.	10
Īsti nē, tikai gribēju zināt, kāpēc tieši jūs domājāt, ka viņš ir aprīkots. (jo es, godīgi sakot, to neredzu)	10
Neiekļaujiet mani šajā mums! Tikai jokoju.. Mums vajag nedaudz mīlestības un ātri.	17,18
Kāpēc lai viņi beigtu mest savus sūdus. Tas šķiet praktiskāk nekā milzīgs santehnikas tīkls.	3
[NAME] vairs nevar mums nodarīt pāri.	27
Jūs pārspējāt nerfed [NAME]. Izklausās, ka līmeņu sarakstiem ir nozīme.	27
[RELIGION] Baznīca ir izvarojusi bērnus gadu desmitiem, par ko mēs zinām. Visticamāk, simtiem gadu. Iespējams, kopš tās pastāvēšanas.	27
Izņemot krekliņus, optiskās preces ir kā pārdomas. Kaut viņi to pastiprinātu.	27
Viņa nav varonis, ko mēs esam pelnījuši, viņa ir varone, kas mums ir.	10
no visiem kāpēc AC?	7
TIK DAUDZ.	27
Tas, ka [NAME] un [NAME] dodas velotūrē, ir lieliski IDK, kāpēc man tas tik ļoti patīk	18
Uzliekot austiņas ar neitrālu dziesmu	27
Tu sasodīti nopietni? Tas ir pārkāpums??	2
Tu noteikti domāji, ka nē. XD	27
Šis vīrietis izskatās daudz vecāks bez vāciņa	22

Piekritu. Ir r/clevercomebacks, bet tas vienkārši nav tas.	4
Tumšais kristāls, Nebeidzams stāsts, Labirints. Mana svētā trīsvienība man bērnībā gan patika, gan biedēja.	18
Viss, kas nepieciešams, ir tikai mazliet prakse un paldies!	5,15
Kā mūža neprecēts cilvēks [NAME] mani aizvaino. Šķiet, ka esmu nošķirta no kaut kādas demogrāfiskas grupas, bez kuras viņi var dzīvot :(	9
Tik rāpojoši. Lika man pārbaudīt slēdzenes.	3,11
[NAME] Es ienīstu savu dzimto pilsētu	2
Tu aiztaisi muti	2
&gt;Es domāju paskaties uz sociālistisko Vāciju. Paskatieties uz Garo nažu nakti.	27
Ak, tas ir briesmīgi	14
Kurā pusē stāsts? Paldies par informāciju!	6,15
Tādiem cilvēkiem kā jūs ar priekšlaicīgu ejakulāciju un sliktu higiēnu nevajadzētu rakstīt garus ierakstus. Vai es to daru pareizi?	10
Ja nu vienīgi autobusos būtu gaismas vai kas	27
yikes, es to nelasu, salvetes ir tur, kungs, jauku dienu	20
Nē, tas nav tas	10
ak, varbūt nākamreiz	27
Nu kāds ir ievietojis sastāvdaļas zemāk esošajos komentāros. Es joprojām esmu iesācējs visā vegānu lietā.	27
Tev veicas!	0
Apskatiet šo abonentu populārākās ziņas. Cik tālu ir jāritina, lai nokļūtu līdz ierakstam &quot;vīrieši ir miskaste&quot;?	6
Āmurs!	27
Protams, es atceros laiku, kad es nezināju, kas ir kalorijas. Es biju bērns.	27
Man ir bijušas dažas tulznas no karstām šuvēm, bet nekas tik slikts...	27
Paldies, ja jūs skatītos uz kameru, kas fotografē jūsu ausi, jūs to nevarētu redzēt.	15
Vienkārši zini, ka tu esi vīrietis. Dodieties uz salām. Go Flames.	27
Kurš saka, ka viņi nebija? Ja tā bija, iespējams, [NAME] tos ignorēja vai noslīcināja.	27
:) Paldies!	15
Varbūt pamēģini padzīvot nedaudz ilgāk, pirms runā par lietām, par kurām nezini, nosvīdis. NĀKAMAIS!	3
Ja jūs izlasītu citus manus ierakstus, jūs zinātu, ka es mēģināju to pabeigt atbildīgā veidā, un viņš tik ļoti atteicās	27
Lieliski, patīk ievads! Es pilnībā saprotu, ko tu saki!	0
Es negribētu redzēt citu [NAME] situāciju, kurā [NAME] atkal tiek ievainots, jo viņš nebija pilnībā atveseļojies.	2
Ļoti mīlu puspurpuru homie	18
Molonu labe!!!	27
[NAME] sūtīja savu vienīgo dēlu gūt vārtus mūsu pildspalvu labā! Esam IZPILDĪTI!	27
Es zinu pāris cilvēkus, kuri ir. Tas ir pārsteidzoši skatīties.	17
Jābūt grūtai dzīvei, kad viss, par ko varat domāt, ir skumji stāsti, kas neļauj jums kaut ko izbaudīt.	25
Vai man vajadzētu šo skatīties? Vai tas mani saasinās?	7
ES ticu tavām spējām. Dariet to, kas jums ir piemērots. Ceru, ka arī tu drīz jutīsies labāk. ♥️🙂	5,20
Tā bija viena no lietām, par ko es nedomāju, un es par to jau devu delta.	27
Tas ir skumji. Man ir 16 gadi, un tur, kur es esmu, ir daudz mana vecuma atistu. Tas ir lieliski.	0
Te tāpat! Es pārāk ilgi domāju par to, vai la jolla/Encinitas ir pazīstams kā &quot;dārgumu krasts&quot;	4
Vai jums ir kaut kas, kas nav anekdotisks, ko teikt? Arī pierādīšanas pienākums ir lieta, jūs iesniedzāt pretenziju, pierādiet to vai bāc	2
Es domāju, ka viņi ir sarkastiski, ievērojiet /s	3
Es domāju, ka tā bija, bet es patiešām norādīju uz to, kā svilpt pēc tam	27
Vainīgs ir toksiskais feminisms	2
Izrādās, viņi nekļūdījās arī attiecībā uz [NAME]	27
Tagad mums ir nepieciešams [NAME], lai atkal apvienotos ar [NAME]	8

tik priecīgs, ka paņēmām šo puisi. kad spēlējām pret viņu, bija absolūti bail. čalis bija zonā.	17

Oho, jūs, ļaudis, esat sāļi par starpposma zaudēšanu! Nožēlojams?	25
Es izmantoju savējos Consumer Cellular klientiem, kuri uz mani ir dusmīgi, jo viņiem ir jāiestata Apple konts, lai izmantotu savu iPhone tālruni.	11
Lol, kāda lieliska publika. Varbūt bagāti cilvēki, sakot &quot;nāc ubagot&quot;, ir līdzīgi kā wtf bro.	1
pilnam video	27
Jā... šī apakšgrupa mani pārmeta par to, ka es ienīstu lietu nomāšanu un joprojām atsakās atzīt savas lielās kļūdas	10
Hei, vai tu kādreiz esi skatījies soprānus?	7
&quot;Es darīšu to, kas man jādara.&quot;	27
Es labprāt redzētu kādu uzmundrinājumu un smaidus malā, nevis kliegt un vaimanāt.	4
Paldies.	15
Es gribu būt māsa ♥️ Man ir daudz nagu laku Es palīdzēšu!!	5,8
Tas ir briesmīgi, ja kādam, kurš neļauj sev smieties, ir reddit konts	9
Paldies, šķiet, ka tā ir vienprātība.	15
Vai kāds cits to lasīja un teica: &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot;?	3
Es nokārtošu &quot;Es neraudu tu raudi!&quot; daļa. Jā, es raudu.	25
Liels paldies Es novērtēju entuziasmu btw vai jūs vairāk vai mazāk zināt, cik daudz vietas man būs nepieciešams, lai to instalētu?	15
Ak, tad tam ir jēga! Paldies, ka veltījāt laiku, lai izskaidrotu. 😊	15
Šis konkrētais kvartāls, iespējams, ir viens no sliktākajiem pilsētā.	10,11
Kad atgriežas kaujas punkts par komandas nārstu?	27
Viņš ir daudz sliktāka [NAME] versija. Nedomāju, ka kāds viņu ieliek savā top 15, izņemot Bears fanus.	10
Tu esi pretīgs	11
1. Izmantojiet vistas ciskas 2. Sausumam nav nozīmes ar tik daudz tauku.	27
Tieši tā. Mēs esam šeit tikai naudas dēļ, dupši.	2
Viņa droši vien tevi krāpj. :(	25
vismaz jūs saņemat sitienu	27
Reakcija tika slēpta zem pārsēja lielās farmācijas nanobotu tehnoloģijas dēļ, kas palīdzēja noslēpt PATIESĪBU. :P	22,27
Tas galvenokārt būtu pašmāju terorisms, kas būtu dusmīgs uz visiem cilvēkiem, kas bēg no aizjūras terorisma.	2
Labs zvans — šī iemesla dēļ es neplānoju pieņemt iesniegumus	4
Personīgi apvainojumi šeit nav atļauti. 1 nedēļas aizliegums par pirmo pārkāpumu.	10
Es to nesen skatījos, un tas ir tik pārsteidzošs šovs!	0
Kāpēc jūs pieminējāt [NAME]? Lol	1
Nekārdini mani!	10
Ceru, ka saņemsiet vajadzīgo palīdzību. Patiesi.	20
Neesam pārliecināti, vai mēs viņu vairs varam saukt par ingveru. Šī matu līnija nonāca lejupslīdē, kas padarīja 2009. gadu kaunā.	6
Es mīlu šo ahahah	18
Jūs, puiši, esat kā sērkociņš, kas radīts debesīs ♥️♥️♥️	0
Ak jā, man tie patika. Pirms tumšajiem laikiem. Pirms FOX dienām mazāk Netflix.	4,17
Vispirms [NAME], tagad [NAME]. Apturiet konkus. Lūdzu.	3
Šis ir viens no sliktākajiem, ko esmu redzējis...	11
[NAME] viņa ACL iemeslu dēļ. Lai gan, pieņemot, ka visi sarakstā iekļautie ir piemēroti spēlēt, es teikšu [NAME].	4
Gandrīz kā iemīlējies [NAME].	18
[NAME] tika *patiesībā melnajā sarakstā* ar &quot;upuri&quot;, bet jā *viņam* noteikti bija tiesības iekļaut *tos*... ko?	27
Atgādini man!	27
Es viņus pārzinu ar stāstiem par gadījumiem, kad dfaq beidzas šokolādes kūka, atgādinot viņiem, ka arī mums dažreiz var būt nelīdzens.	27
Jūsu lietotājvārds liek man domāt, ka jūs novērtētu šo manu joku.	1
ŠIS EKRĀŅUZŅĒMUMS.	27
Acīmredzot jūs vēlētos Albertu ar cenzūru par to, ko mēs lasām. Bull jums.	3
Es noteikti tā ceru	20
Jūs nopietni pārpublicējāt to pašu pārpublicējumu, kuru pārpublicējāt vēlreiz.	3
Iesim gooooo WHI	27
izveidoju savu pirmo reddit kontu, lai to noraidītu. Paldies?	15,27
tas ir ļoti attīstīts domāšanas veids, un es nedomāju, ka es to varēju darīt, kad man bija 18 gadi	0
Mmmmm garšīgi 🅱️estrogēni	27
Sasodīts. Man žēl. Kāds posts.	24
Ak, interesants lietotājvārds	0,4
Paldies, ka to pateicāt. Tā ir necieņa pret mani. Un tas sāp.	15
Tev vajadzēja tajā iesist viņa galvu.	2
Izskatās, ka emocionāli un fiziski dauzīt sievu un bērnus toreiz nebija veltīgi.	27
&gt; neaplikt nevienu, cik stulba ideja.	3
Pirms kaut ko pastāstīt... ko tieši jūs no tā vēlaties?	7,27
Es vienkārši pasaku sev, ka mani saliks kādai meitenei. Viņai nebūs jāizturas pret mani kā pret fiksatoru.	27
Vienīgais satraukums ir tas, ka daži no jums aizraujas ar katru mazo lietu, ko dara Eureka.	27
Negaidiet. Pārņemiet kontroli pār savu dzīvi un dodieties prom. Jūs zināt, ka tas notiks.	27
Ak, paldies [NAME], ka notvērāt mani!	15
Ohh.. Paldies!	15
Un *viņi ir tie*, kas runā par NPC!	27
Nu paldies par dalīšanos. Man tas patika. Vai jūs zināt kādu citu no viņiem, kas nav labi pazīstami?	15,18
Petijs ot [NAME]. Ejam. Hokeja dievi nevar mūs tik ļoti pamest	27
Un tomēr izskatās, ka viena lieta, ko tu nevari, ir lasīt. Kauns kauns.	12
Sūds tev taisnība! Es nespēju noticēt, ka arī to aizmirsu pieminēt! Paldies, ka norādīji ;)	15
Arī es satraucos no pilnīgi iedomātām sarunām 😅 Mēģinu meditēt un iemācīties atturēties no nokļūšanas truša bedrē.	20
Ja sieviete ar spēku iespiež vīrieša dzimumlocekli savā makstī, tas ABSOLŪTI IR noziegums. Neesat pārliecināts, ko jūs smēķējat.	6
[NAME], es ļoti priecājos redzēt viņu attīstāmies	13
mans puisis nevienam nerūp	9,25
Kontrakcijas ir līdzvērtīgas....ķermenis var tikt galā tikai ar...mums sievietēm ar dzemdībām.....man nepatīk kā šis cilvēks runā.	10
Kā Jeep vadītājam man pastāvīgi jāatgādina citiem Jeep vadītājiem, ka 4WD/AWD tikai braucot rada atšķirības. Ikvienam ir 4 riteņu pietura.	27
lai fotoattēli izskatās skaisti	0
Varbūt [NAME].	2
Bet tie ir iespaidīgi.	0
Viņa ir absolūti satriecoša šajā fotoattēlā	0
Dummy, es tev nepiekrītu	10
Es mēģinātu berzēt alkoholu, liels procents. Man izskatās taukaina.	20
Bruto. Es ienīstu tos atkārtoti lietojamos audumus, jo tie saglabā smakas. Tev ir kaķi? Es zinu, es jūtu to smaržu.	11
Es nezinu nevienu, izņemot savu, es baidos.	14
Vērtīgākais komentārs	0
[NAME], iemācies gramatiku un pieturzīmes. Varbūt izmantojiet dažas rindkopas. Tikai ideja.	3
Jā. Ja mēģināt neignorēt fotoattēlus, tas ir tieši tur.	4
Šis interneta svešinieks arī ļoti lepojas ar jums! Lai iet!!!	0,21
Man šķita, ka tas jau ir iznācis, un es to palaidu garām.	6
Idioti noraida tavu pareizo komentāru.	9
Ja tā ir taisnība, tas ir ļoti izmisīgi. Varētu domāt, ka viņam ir kāds labāks saziņas veids.	25
Es uzskatu, ka šeit varat meklēt pakalpojumu sniedzējus. Veiksmi un veiksmi jums.	15
Jo hierarhija baidās, ka viņi tiks sadedzināti.	14
Nē, es nedomāju, ka panteras ir pietiekami labas	10
[NAME] kāds tu esi, ja uzskatāt, ka iepriekš minētais komentārs nozīmē, ka esmu vājprātīga pret sieviešu uzvedību pārāk ilgi.	27
Tas ir forši.	27
Es atnācu šeit, lai to pateiktu.	27
Ak, kāds bija šīs izrādes nosaukums. Tas šķiet tik pazīstams. Vai neesi skatījies MTV 15 gadus, nezinu?	7
Dzīve tevi pārspēj gadiem	27
Ceru, bet šaubos...	20
Ooo. Skaties! Liels cilvēks šeit!	13
2010. gads. Tā kā [NAME] ir izmisis, [NAME] atgriežas. Sūds bija zelts	27
Es tik tālu neietu, bet paranoiskā šizofrēnija noteikti var kādam to nodarīt. Tomēr pat viegla sociālā trauksme to var izraisīt	27
Oi mums vēži arī viņu negrib! Ar cieņu nododam viņa dzimšanas dienu aprīlim	0,10
Tam gandrīz noteikti nevajadzēja nonākt OT. SEC refs ir slikti CBB refs ir slikti	10
Parasti piliens n roll. Šajā gadījumā es novilktu drēbes, jo šaubos, ka ripināšana palīdzētu.	6
Ejam puiši	27
Nepavisam. Tas, protams, ir lieliski finansiālu apsvērumu dēļ, bet tad tas liek man uztraukties par to, cik daudz laika viņai būs attiecībām.	25
ES piekrītu!!! Viņa raksturs ir tik ļoti audzis visas sērijas laikā, un es biju ļoti vīlies, ka viņš beidzās ar viņu.	4,9
Matchroom komanda noraida [NAME], jo vairs nepastāv, debesu mediju ietekme ir biedējoša	14
[NAME] nevēlējās sazināties ar [NAME] (saprātīgi), un [NAME] bija vairāk ārpolitikas pieredzes un akreditācijas datu nekā [NAME] tajā laikā.	27
Es jūs mīlu draugi. Alus uz manis	18
Diemžēl nevienam svarīgam nerūp jūsu absurdie uzskati.	25
liekot mums izskatīties pēc pankiem, kas rada vilšanos	9
Pārtrauciet šīs attiecības TAGAD. Un lūdzu mācieties no tā!!	3,5
Es likumīgi nekad neko neesmu dzirdējis par vīriešiem invalīdiem, kuri paļaujas uz prostitūciju, kā arī neesmu dzirdējis nevienu argumentu, kas izmanto vīriešus ar invaliditāti kā prostitūcijas racionalizāciju.	27
Ak, vecais cauruļvads no [NAME] uz [NAME] uz [NAME] uz [NAME].	27
iirc viņi mainīja dažus serveru nosaukumus, iespējams, ka tas izraisīja dažas problēmas	27
[NAME] pret īstu treneri	27
Iespējams, racionālākais veids, kā aplūkot visu šo scenāriju. Paldies, ka ievietojāt šo informāciju. Šis komentārs mani atkal noteica.	15,20
Es provocēju, pārāk smagi elpojot. Un jā, es to ienīstu.	2
Kāds izdarīja līdzīgu joku un saņēma 500 negatīvus balsis.	22
[NAME] bija lielisks treneris	0
Fuuuuuck. Tas ir sliktākais, ko esmu redzējis.	2
Tas ir. Lai spēlētu uzticami, parasti ir nepieciešami 5 lejup un 5 uz augšu. Arī vadu.	3
[NAME], šī vietne ir vēzis. Tāpat man patīk, ka galvenā &quot;izklaide&quot; tajā ir tieši uzmākšanās.	18
Šis ir patiešām foršs un labi izgatavots!	0
Pārsteidz mani, ko tagad?	7,26
Es vienmēr mīlēšu Ohare, jo tā ir lidosta, kas paredzēta tikai mājām	18
Spēlējiet Farmville, ja nevarat turpināt.	3
Viņam ir gandrīz 25 gadi, viņš neprot šaut, neprot driblēt un nedara neko lielisku. Viņš daudz neuzlabosies.	10
Tātad [NAME] patiešām mīl spēlēt uz soliņa pret otras komandas iesācējiem puslaiku beigās. Tiešām atrast visas iespējamās tvertnes malas.	4
jā, šķiet, ka viņi klīst apkārt diezgan droši...	4
Priecājos, ka jums patika cilvēks, jā, tas bija arī diezgan spontāni, es lūdzos, lai es negribētu izdarīt kādu bartarda kustību un netiktu iesprūsts. lol.	0,1,17
Es atkal esmu šeit, lai pateiktu, ka man patīk jūsu māksla, un tas man sagādā prieku, kad publicējat to šajā sub-bye!	17,18
Hmm... [NAME] izskatās kā [NAME] no Nickelodeon	27
Pārāk viegli. 2021. gada 12. janvārī es pārdodu par 18 000 $, tāpēc varu būt dusmīga uz sevi, ka nepārdodu topu	3
Koledža ir ļoti vientuļa vieta. Ļoti saspringta, ļoti vientuļa. [NAME]. Veiksmi tur, cilvēks.	25
Tāda sajūta, kad ir tavs talismans, bet nav neviena viņa spēlētāja. Atvainojos Jupi	27
Omg, paldies!	15
Interesanti. Pat ja vairums tam nepiekrīt, es labprāt sagaidītu sava veida augšāmcelšanos IX.	18
Taisnība! Viņš droši vien ir vienkārši vientuļš. Paldies par labajiem vārdiem :)	5,15
Tas ir pārsteidzošs	0
Šķiet, ka [NAME] iepazīstina ar komiķiem filmā &quot;Kam tas vispār pieder?&quot;	27
skaidrs, ka neviens nesaprot manu joku.	3,9
Adorācija noteikti ir kaut kas, ko es varētu darīt vairāk. Paldies!	15
Tas ir diezgan precīzi	4
Arī viena no manām mīļākajām šī stāsta daļām.	27
Kāds bija šī gala rezultāts?	7
Tie ir tieši vērsti pret civiliedzīvotājiem. Tas ir pretīgi.	11
izskatās forši, es to gribu tagad.	0
Aplausi nāca no [NAME] un viņa grupas.	0
Hm, atvainojiet? Es esmu *rullējošs* zaķa bedre, paldies	15
Pirmajā kombinācijā, ja jūs vienkārši veicat b+k tā vietā, lai pat mēģinātu spert, tas rada vēl 1 bojājumu, acīmredzami nav daudz, bet jā, tikai doma	22
Sievietēs man nekas nešķiet pievilcīgs.	10
-30°, tad atkal man ir tikai 16. Ir pagājis kāds laiciņš, kopš ir iestājušies šie tempi, tāpēc tas nav patīkami.	11
ARĪ. DAUDZ. VILCINĀŠANĀS. Lietotājam [NAME] vajadzēja to ievietot tīklā sekundi agrāk	27
Kā jūs tos ieguvāt bez maksas?	27
Ļoti foršs.	27
Izmežģīta ceļgala atiestatīšana sāp kā ellīgi, taču uzreiz pēc tam jūtos daudz labāk.	23
Es zinu, ka joprojām bieži apmeklēšu Argonaut un citu manas apkārtnes ģimenei piederošo alkoholisko dzērienu veikalu.	22
Kāds ar erektilās disfunkcijas jau nevar (parasti) saņemt orgasmu. Ko pie velna tu runā?	2
Pūkains un zvīņains sasodīts	27
Viss šis komentārs ir tikai rēciņš par rēcināšanu. Reeeception	27
Varbūt ar pareizrakstību, bet viņa tētis katru nedēļu skatās SNL.	27
Oho! Esmu gandrīz 2 pilsētas un nav pat tik auksts :o	22
Tas ir rāpojoši.	14
Labprāt arī ziedotu!	18
Es domāju, ka manas bažas būtu tādas, ja cits suns uzbruktu manējam, viņi nespētu sevi aizstāvēt	7
Kāda burvīga smegmas peļķe.	0
Esmu glaimots, bet esmu laba [RELIĢIJAS] šalle	0
Sindroma &quot;Man ir kamera, tāpēc es esmu neuzvarams&quot; rezultāts.	27
Kāpēc kaimiņš ir uzrakstīts nepareizi?	7
Tas būtu labi, es domāju.	4
Pārfrāzējot [NAME], tas manā sirdī iedvesa siltas sajūtas.	17,27
Tas ir interesanti. Vai esat to izmantojis, lai reģistrētos daudzās vietnēs/pakalpojumos?	7
Un lielas krūtis! Piemēram, ko?	27
Tu neesi zaudētājs. Jūs esat vesels un pilnīgs cilvēks sev.	0
Mēs jau gadiem ilgi esam saistījuši šo viltīgo ukraiņu vietni, tāpēc esiet prātīgi.	27
Šķidrumiem es varētu atstāt &quot;7&quot; un pārliecināties, ka jūsu pilsoņi ir vienīgā rase, kas var nārstot ļoti mežonīgos apgabalos.	27
Lieliska kolāža, es tik daudz iemācījos no visiem šiem puišiem. Kopiena ir lieliska, nekonfiscējamā konference bija lieliska 🙏🏽🙏🏽	0
Lol, tu esi tik tuvu tam, lai to iegūtu, vecīt. Tik tuvu.	1
Jā, mūrnieku lapsenes ir nejaukas mazās Takera sugas.	27
Paldies, ka paskaidrojāt. Es tikai domāju par to, cik liela daļa manas ģimenes ir izvēlīga (pieaugušie un bērni).	15
Patiesībā varbūt OP nav INTP, vai esat par to domājuši!!	7
Ja [NAME] un [NAME] ir atpakaļ un [NAME] gaida spārnos, vai jūs joprojām vēlaties EDGE 1. raundā?	27
Tā ir apmales sajūta	27
Žēl, ka tev tur bija jādzīvo. Labā ziņa ir tā, ka viņi to nojauks 2020. gadā.	25
Ņemot vērā, cik skaists ir katrs cilvēks, uz Zemes ir pārāk daudz neglītuma.	0
/u/897w346354365fdddfs teica: &gt; Tu esi smieklīgs Tu esi stulbs	1
Jā, es tikai ceru uz to, ka tur būs kāds lielāks idiots par mani. :-)	27
Perfekti! Ievietojiet to viņiem saprotamā formā!	27
Tāpēc, ka jūs uzskatāt par &quot;garlaicīgu&quot;. Meitenēm patīk drāma. Tā ir lieta.	27
Tas man lika pasmaidīt. Paldies!! Un jā, noteikti aizstājot viņu manā atsauces sarakstā lol.	1,15
Loģika un fakti šajā apakšā ir aizliegti. Patiešām dīvaini, ka cilvēki ir tik jutīgi.	27
Labā ziņa ir tāda, ka, tiklīdz visi uzplaukuma izraisītāji izmirs, jūs vairs nevarēsit vainot nepatīkamus vecus cilvēkus.	17
Cik jauks mazs nelaimes gadījums tu izrādījies	0,27
Tikai gribēju pieminēt — Brazos Bend ir slēgts plūdu dēļ līdz nākamajai nedēļai.	27
Jo ar 44% no komandas kopējiem TD lomiem ir par maz!?! Lūdzu, sakiet man, ka tas ir BS.	27
Tas ir šausmīgi, labi zināt, ka viņa ir kopā ar lielisku puisi.	0,11
Ak, lūdzu, pastāstiet man par iespējamām sankcijām	27
Es esmu izmantojis Greiss poke check [NAME], kopš tas notika.	27
Jā, paldies, nepateicīgais bāleliņš.....	2
Es nezinu, kas ir [NAME], bet tagad esmu ziņkārīgs, redzot vārdu “atkal”.	7
Lieliska ideja! Paldies :)	15
Jā, es jūtu līdzi šim noskaņojumam. Mičiganas fanu plūsma cfb subreddit šogad bija milzīga. Pat kā fans es biju aizkaitināts.	3
Nu [NAME] lika man pasmieties	17
Ak, elegants vīrietis	0
Es zvēru ar [NAME], es vērsīšos pie jums. Tā vietā, lai bēgtu, es nākšu tieši pie tevis.	27
Es vienmēr sniedzu savu atrunu, kad viņš prasa manu tālruņa numuru. Es saprotu un cienu savu situāciju, dažiem tas varētu būt darījuma pārtraukums.	27
[NAME] smieklīgi, meitene... ne tik ļoti	17,27
Manu kolēģi piekrāpa viņas astoņus gadus vecais draugs, un viņai ir jāpavada nakts, tāpēc es nevaru pat nopūsties.	27

Labākā NYG drafta izvēle EVER!!!!	27
Svētie dūmi, labi darbi!!!	15
Es zinu, tāpēc ir nedaudz žēl, ka viņiem nav pārbaudes.	19,27
Labi, mēs to sapratām. Tu esi tops.	0,27
Mēs beidzot zaudējām spēli, kamēr es sajaucu savu taro klāju, un tagad es nevaru izlemt, vai man vajadzētu mēģināt vēlreiz, vai veiksme ir beigusies	9
Ievietojiet galvu blenderī un atstājiet to visu gadu. Izslēdziet to oktobrim un novembra pusei... pēc tam atkal tajā	27
Man jums ir sliktas ziņas. Es izvēlējos Chargers, Colts, Saints un Cowboys, lai uzvarētu. Tātad Ērgļi varētu uzvarēt :/	9
Vismaz viņai ir taisnība	4
Es uzskatu, ka šis termins ir grila inspektors	27
[NAME] nāve ir tik... bezjēdzīga. Kāpēc? KĀPĒC??? Pamatotie dievi mūs ir pametuši	16
Tu īsti nevienu nekaitini. Pārsvarā mēs tevi vienkārši žēlojam.	27
Interesanti. Tik atšķirīga pieeja nekā evaņģēlistu centieni, ko esmu pieredzējis no “galvenās līnijas” [RELIGION].	27
Protams, cilvēks, es to ļoti novērtēju. Bet tas ir labi, es varu jums nosūtīt ziņojumu šeit. Ir labi:)	15
Dave &amp; Buster&#39;s ir lielisks ieteikums!	0

Citās ziņās; Ūdens joprojām ir slapjš.	27
&quot;Lūk, jūsu sasodīti labi padarīts ar rozā krāsu centrā [NAME], gluži kā jūsu stulbais, sasodīts galds vēlas!&quot;	2
Tas pats. Uzreiz pēc ekrāna nomaiņas. Tāpēc tagad man ir saplaisājis tālrunis	27
Būtu grūti pateikt šo kombināciju ar taisnu seju pēc sasodītā nekārtības, kas notika pēdējā UFC pasākumā.	27
Sapratu. Žēl, ka tu tā jūties, vīrietis. Es ceru, ka jūs atradīsit savu veidu, kā ietekmēt spēli vai izbaudīt to nākamajā gadā.	20
Lai veicas un izklaidējies	17,20
Godīgi sakot, esmu tikai priecīgs, ka mani aizmainīja pret jums, nevis ar tādu komandu kā Leafs vai H*bs	17
Šobrīd man ir jātupās sniegā stindzinošā aukstumā sava daudzdzīvokļu kompleksa pagalmā, turot rokās mazu bong	11
Ak, jā, kādu nobalsoja par atšķirību. Kādreiz pieņemošs.	27
Ja tā ir taisnība, man ir skumji, ka viņš aiziet, bet es novēlu viņam tikai to labāko.	25
Es domāju, ka viņi to darīja Džibutijā, manuprāt, un iepriekš Šrilankā. Cerams, ka Kenija varēs izvairīties no parādu slazdiem	20
Apsveicu! Izbaudiet bezmaksas šķēli, es domāju, ka jūs zināt, ko ar šo darīt 🍕	15,17
[NAME] ir diezgan jauks...	0
Interesanta lasāmviela, bet šausmīgs formāts mobilajā ierīcē.	13
Ar 30 bumbām nepietiks, lai es justos labi, skrienot [NAME] un viņa karjeru 0,291 OBP katru dienu	27

Ak velns nē	26

Es neesmu redzējis nevienu [NAME] rakstu. Taču pēdējā laikā ir bijuši daži [NAME] raksti.	22
Tam joprojām nebūtu jēgas. Problēma nav izskatā	10
viņi jau paši sabojāja savu dzīvi ar romānu. otra laulātā apziņa ir tikai viņu savtīgās rīcības sekas.	3
Ja es kādreiz to ieraudzīšu savā reģionā, tā būs lode galvā. Jāvelk Reddit noteikumi.	2
Būšu paldies :)	15
Viņš tagad sargā un aizstāv eņģeļus 💚	4,5
Izlabots jūsu labā	5
Un tad viņi tika notriekti	27
Varbūt tas ir ļengans un trīcēšanai ir jēga, kad komentāros tevi noliek. loool lasīt dažas mārciņas.	27
... [NAME] pamanīts sajukuma sindroma slimnieks. Ko jūs, trakie vājprātīgie, sakāt... Meli un meli, kā arī nevietā baiļu kurināšana kļūst ļoti kaitinošas...	3
Tie pirksti mani traucē visvairāk	3
Paldies cilvēk 🙏🏽	15
Nelietojiet loģiku. Nav forši.	10
AOC izmantoja precīzu versiju, ko [NAME] bija uzstājis gadiem ilgi. Tāpēc nav pārsteigums, ka tā ir kodolfobija.	27
4. Izejiet un parādiet, ka [NAME] joprojām ir stud, un brīvajiem aģentiem vajadzētu vēlēties šeit ierasties un spēlēt kopā ar mūsu jauno kodolu.	27
Varbūt viņa pabeigs Wardenclyffe Tower un apturēs Slappy un viņa monstrus!	27
Vēlaties pārāk lielu un liesu, lai tas būtu dabiski sasniedzams.	8

Lūdzu, ārstējiet mani ar modernām zālēm. Man ir gastroparīze.	5
Atkal tā ir nezāle, nevis heroīns. Smēķējiet to. Vai pārdot to.	3
Mēģiniet bezrūpīgi nodot viņiem savu karti tā, it kā viņi to būtu nometuši. Es domāju, ka ir normāli būt kautrīgam. *nododot uz izejas, pretējā gadījumā tas var kļūt neērti	12
Mans ETL mēģināja mums iestāstīt, ka katrai kastītei mums vajadzētu aizņemt ne vairāk kā 30 sekundes, un visi, kas par to jautāju, ir smējušies un nodēvējuši to par muļķībām.	11
Slavējiet [NAME] par REALITĀTI! ŪU!!!!!	23

Kāpēc tad viņš nav tie cilvēki, kas klīst?	7
Pirksta kustināšana [NAME] bija neticami seksīga.	0
Kāds finišs	0,13
Man tas ir smieklīgi, jo visi šī gada mēneša skolotāji (ar 1 izņēmumu) ir bijuši dabaszinātnēs.	1
Šie tiesneši šovakar ir ārkārtīgi šausmīgi. Tāpat arī ar zobeniem, bet nu, daži briesmīgi zvani.	14
Priecājos, ka tev ir kāds, kas tev palīdz! Varbūt laika gaitā jums tas kļūs vieglāk.	17,23
Kāds riekstkoks lol	1
Ak, es vēlos. 40.	8
Vainīgs arī!	24
Man ir kroņi, un es domāju, ka man vajag mutes aizsargu, bet šķiet, ka man vairs nav.	22
Liels paldies, es novērtēju atsauksmes un nosūtīšu tās ceļā.	0,15
Es būšu pārsteigts, ja *Monty Python&#39;s Life of Brian* nebūtu viens no tiem.	26
Nu tas ir pretīgi	11
Tāpat kā tajā laikā, viņš nebija viens no labākajiem aizsargiem līgā. Bet izauga par vienu.	0
Jā, un Brazīlijā mēs rakstām tikai kursīvā, lai es nesaprastu šos cilvēkus.	4
Tas vēl nav noticis. Vienkārši runājiet ar vadītāju vai HR. Tikmēr neaizņemies nepatikšanas.	5

Tas jums iegūs 9125 CENTUS. Nabaga dvēsele reizināja 365 ar 25, neapzinoties kļūdu	27
Viņi abi ir labi savā veidā. Bet asv ir smieklīgāka lol	1
Vai jūs nogalinājāt haizivi, lai pats iegūtu haizivs zobus savai kaklarotai, vai arī tā bija iepriekš sagatavota? Paldies [NAME]!	15
Es sāku uztraukties, ka [NAME] nav kārtībā	5
Es paskatīšos, ko es varu darīt, paldies man.	15
Pierakstiet arī manu vārdu, lol, tas bija tik šausmīgi, ka par to esam pelnījuši sāpes un ciešanas!	11
nu, vairums no viņiem pat tik tālu netiks, jo otrreiz, kad tu sāc to skaidrot, viņi aizbāž ausis un sāk kliegt par sociālismu.	27
&quot;Alnis nogalināja manus vecākus.&quot;	2
Esmu atklājies sociālajos medijos. Tas lika man justies labāk, tāpēc man ir vienalga, kas par to sakāms.	23
Tas nedarbojas tik labi, kā jūs domājat, bet paldies jebkurā gadījumā	15
Tas man ļoti noderēja. Paldies, ka tik labi izskaidroji.	15
Tas padarīja manu lietaino dienu	17

Paldies, ka apzinājos sevi, jo kā ārsts, kurš mācās, es ikdienā jūtos muļķīgi. Tas ir ļoti pazemojošs darbs	15
Jā, jūsu troļļošana ir ļoti laba. Jūs esat tik drosmīgs, ka devāt mums iespēju nobalsot par savu zeķu kontu uz elli.	27
es arī vienmēr pīpēju ar locītavu, viņi ir labākie draugi	27
Diemžēl tas ir pietiekami reāli. Kin ir kādu laiku atradušies savos tīkla stūros.	27

Tas uzņēma pagriezienu.	27
Šķiet, ka [NAME] tika nošauts no **japāņu stara**	27
Stāsts [NAME] ir diezgan pārsteidzošs. Izcilas lietas! Manas ausis ir cieši piestiprinātas. Paldies.	0
Tātad nē. Viss, kas jums ir, ir meli un maldi. Paldies par apstiprinājumu	15
Ak! Sāp, jo tā ir taisnība.	25

Protestantisms nebeidz mani pārsteigt ar savu teoloģijas joku un neesošo vēsturisko pamatojumu.	27
Man patīk ceļi, skolas un dzeramais ūdens? Jūs sajaucat vīrieti par paranoiķi.	7,18
Jūtas labi cilvēks	17

Tātad... viņa tikko laimēja loterijā!!	13
Man ir grūti atrast to, uz ko jūs šeit atsaucāties. Vai jūs varētu pievienot kaut ko, kas uz to norāda?	6
Paldies, es zinu, ka tev ir taisnība, es vienkārši pārdomāju	15
Pagaidiet, lai es nemēģinātu pārdot savus skuvekļus, stāstot klientiem, ka tie nav pietiekami labi un varētu darīt labāk? Sasodīts.	3
Esmu pamodies blakus dažām šokējošām lietām, bet iedomājieties, ka savā istabā atrodu policijas mašīnas augšdaļu.	27
Es tajā satiku 3 gadus vecus cilvēkus	22,27
Ne īsti, drīzāk žogs...	27
Viņš izdarīja. Viņam vajag sejas apmatojumu, un šis matu griezums ir šausmīgs, viņam vajadzētu to vienkārši noskūtiet un sākt no jauna.	27
Saints Moderatori šovakar ir aizņemti ar aizliegšanu!!	27
Pastāsti man pāris	27
Labāk neļaujiet [NAME] viņam tuvoties, kas ar viņas eļļām un viss...	10

Varbūt viņš *pameta* ēku. Ja jūs nevarat viņu atrast, viņš varēja aiziet, jums nezinot. Vai tas ir labāk vai sliktāk?	6,7
Draudēt iedzīt savas māsas okeānā ir nelikumīgi. To sauc par terorisma draudiem vai draudiem, un tas var likt viņai zaudēt piekļuvi jūsu māsām	14
Labi, tad pameklē google. 🤦🏼‍♀️	27
haha jā! Es visu laiku tā darīšu savam kaķim. Šķiet, ka viņš novērtē piespēli	1
Jā, ievērojami samazinot	4
Bet strādnieks, kurš nopelna bagātību, var to ieguldīt un kļūt par kapitāla investoru. Tādā gadījumā viņš burtiski nodrošina kapitālu.	4

Taisnības labad jāsaka, ka es nekauju savu pārtiku	27

Tāpēc, ka viņiem ir jāsacenšas, un tāpēc mēs esam pakļauti vājākajiem no grupas.	27
Tas pats vecais bs	27
ak, lūdzu, nē	10
Mans dēls nav pietiekami vecs, lai atcerētos savu brāli, un mans vīrs un man šķiet, ka tā ir svētība.	18
Vai viņa ir viena?	7
Joprojām neesmu dzirdējis labu iemeslu, kāpēc kavēšanās nav īsāka	27
Mēs tiešām nē!	27
Wtf? Tiešām?	2
Bet bet r/49ers teica, ka tā ir tikai slikta veiksme!	9,25
Puiši, kā mums iet? Jautāju, jo manā valstī stulbā televīzija dod priekšroku Itālijas kausa izcīņai, nevis sasodītam Madrides Real	1,3,5
Jums taisnība, tas ir salīdzināms. Cerams, ka jums viss ir kārtībā	20
Tātad tu kļūsi par Indiju... Jo imigranti... Draugs... Ja tev nekas nav, saki tā.	27
tad nekad nebrauc, jo cilvēks, kas atrodas otrā joslā, var apbraukt un tevi nogalināt	27
Kolāžā. Tagad sakiet man, ka tas nav nedroši...	27
Paldies par atbildi	15
Es uztraucos par savu kolēģi redditor. Šķiet, ka jūs nejūtaties labi, un jums ir halucinācijas. Vai mums būs modifikācija, lai pārbaudītu jūs?	7
Tas ir iespaidīgi, jūs to varat pateikt no viņa pakausi	0
tu man patīc.	18
Kāds ir zemūdens līmenis.	27

Jā, šeit vainīgs ir videokamera.	27
C vitamīns ir ūdenī šķīstošs, tāpēc jūs burtiski nomājat lieko daudzumu.	3,27

Tie ir jauni, taču mazāk nekā mēneša laikā saņēmuši vairāk nekā 100 atsauksmes, tāpēc pieņemu, ka tie ir vienkārši nosodīti. Paldies par ieguldījumu	0,15
Es neteicu, ka tas ir pierādījums tam, ka kaut kas ir krāpniecība bez nākotnes, iespējams, jūs plānojat.	3
Anti-vaxers vairs nav smieklīgi, tagad viņi ir vienkārši biedējoši...	14
Es saprotu, kāpēc jūs nekad nebūsit vadošā amatā.	10
Atvainojiet, es nevaru dzirdēt jūsu bezjēdzīgo āpšu pārņemšanu par mani, dzerot manu 38 collu no vīna pudeles un izbaudot savus papildu 200 $.	24
Jūs esat pelnījuši DAUDZ vairāk pozitīvu balsojumu	0,27
Tas bija tvīts kādu laiku atpakaļ.	27
Nē! Jums tādu nevar būt! Tā ir kokosriekstu kūka!	10

Jums vajadzētu piezvanīt policijai un pastāstīt savam draugam, varbūt varat palikt pie viņa	27
Tas, ka [NAME] ir 50:33 pret uzvarošām komandām, liek domāt, ka nebūtu tik svarīgi, ja viņu sadalījums būtu labāks. Varbūt ir tikuši līdz 7 superbowl, nevis 8.	27
MAN TO PATIEK, man patiktu, ja viņi uztaisītu 2. sezonu... Man ļoti patika	17,18
Diezgan dīvaini, kā vienmēr notiek karš starp &quot;Party music&quot; un &quot;Feelings Music&quot;	6,10

Ja daži mantkārīgi un spēcīgi var nopelnīt, viņi to darīs.	27
Paldies! Un tomēr viņu sauc apmēram 5 vienādi uz Laca	15
Šo lasot mani iepriecināja, un es tevi pat nepazīstu. Turpini darīt savu!🙌🏼	17
Tieši tā, jums ir nepieciešama Holivudas sieviete, kas ir pilngadīga, lai ar viņu sadzīvotu. Pēc 35 vajadzētu būt labi, vai ne?	4,7

Zvēru piens. Mans mīļākais!	17

Daudz laimes dzimšanas dienā [NAME]. Jūs nelasīsit šo ziņojumu, bet tas būs šeit.	5

Pārsteigts, ka viņš ir iekšā. Iedomājos, ka viņš ir satricināts. Viņš kādu laiku atradās uz citas planētas.	26
Medības būtu vismaz atalgojošākas un jautrākas. Katru reizi, kad es vēlos gatavot maltīti RDO, es vienkārši braucu ar zirgu un pieslēdzos pie briežiem.	1
Kādā brīdī mēs visi to ienīstam. Hei, dažreiz ir labi būt patiesam.	4
Vai mēs varam aizmirst, ka šis brīdis notika	12

Es domāju, ka tas ir [NAME]	22
Jā, jo ir optimālais līmenis, kas dabiski nenotiek.	27
Viņi to nedara. Konservatīvie vēlas raksturot jebkuru neticamu ziņu organizāciju kā neuzticamu, jo viņi nevar viegli tikt tām priekšā.	10
Vai viņš tiešām sevi izsita?!	7
Viņa ir pārāk nekaunīga, lai dauzītu apkārt — es gaidīju, kad viņa izņems apgaismes ierīci.	27
Jā, es to uztvēru vairāk kā “nevis mēs, bet radikāļi” mb.	27

Atvainojiet, sapratu, ka nebiju atbildējusi uz jautājumu lol. Es to rakstīju, kad parādījās jūsu atbilde.	24
Viņa plāns būtu darbojies, ja rakstnieki nebūtu teleportējuši [NAME] par šo dramatisko (un bezjēdzīgo) epizodes daļu.	27
[NAME] nav fašists. Velns, viņai pat nav taisnība	10
[NAME] tu esi ķēms...	27

Man tas patiktu... kā darbojas tērzēšana Es esmu šeit diezgan jauns	7,18
To ir ļoti bīstami turēt kopā, un viņi var izlauzties kopā un sākt barot ar citiem ausu kārpiņiem, lai iegūtu spēku.	10,11
Tomēr tas ir labi, jo tas liks jums lolot laimīgos laikus, kamēr tajās atrodaties, nevis atskatīties uz tiem.	17
Meditējiet. Jums var būt nepieciešams meklēt medicīnisko palīdzību. Lai veicas, draugs.	5,15
Es domāju, tā ir sava veida viņas problēma. Viņa vieglprātīgi pieļauj tik daudz garīgu kļūdu.	9
Jūs neesat ne viens, ne otrs.	27
Kāpēc jums šķiet, ka jums ir jāsaprot, kas ir dzīve vienatnē?	7
Nevaru izlemt, vai tas ir tāpēc, ka mēs vēlu spēlējam graudainu basketbolu vai arī mums paveicas un neizbēgami atkāpjas uz vidējo	27

Pa labi? Lielāko daļu dienu es vēlos, lai man būtu patiešām mazi, lai puiši skatītos uz MANI, nevis skatītos uz manu ķermeni.	8
Pagaidiet, jums nepatīk lasīt cilvēku emuāra ziņas vietnē Reddit?	7
Paldies Hārvardai!	15
Kas padara to labi tādu, kāds tas ir?	6

Jā, ņemot vērā, ka ieroči paši par sevi nav problēma (kā es jums tik rūpīgi paskaidroju), tas ir pamatots arguments.	4
Ak, es domāju, ka tas ir par Pistons iekļūšanu izslēgšanas spēlēs. Tā kā es nepievērsu viņiem uzmanību, es domāju, ka tas ir iespējams. Ahahahahaha!	22,26

Izņemot, ka šķiet, ka nemitīgā raustīšanās par DMC bija viena no vairākām lietām, kas varēja novest pie viņu atdalīšanas.	9
Tie vārdi, kurus izmantojāt. Es negribu ticēt, ka tas pastāv.	10
Man ir visu laiku vissliktākā atmiņa. Idk, ja tas ir no visas nezāles, ko es smēķēju, bet man arī ir tukšs prāts kā visu laiku.	11

Es ņemšu PVZ. Jūsu nojauta: &quot;Varbūt kaklu laiks&quot;	27
Paldies. Jā, arī tam ir jēga. Es varētu sevi vainot vairāk nekā vajadzētu	15
Pēc iespējas ātrāk noņemiet to no ceļa. Daži cilvēki apgalvo, ka viņiem tas patīk, tāpēc, iespējams, jūs būsiet viens no tiem dīvainajiem.	5
Cavaliers pārspēja LOL. Varbūt [NAME] un [NAME] šajā ceturksnī var uzņemt vairāk ķieģeļu, šķiet, ka līdz šim tas darbojas	1
Es nezinu, kāpēc jūs pat šādi runājat ar cilvēku miskasti. Tā vietā jums vajadzētu motivēt viņu pamest viņu — vismaz tas būtu produktīvi.	27
Es priecājos, ka šis projekts tiks pabeigts, kad pēc 30 gadiem aiziešu pensijā.	13
Tātad jums nekad nav bijusi fwb situācija, un, ja jums tā ir, jūs esat padarījis nevērtīgu īstām attiecībām ar citām sievietēm? Cerams, ka tas notiks abos virzienos	7

Interesanti. Nekad neesmu par to dzirdējis. Vai tev tas patīk?	13
Tad mani apvainos, ka esmu rasists.	22
Tomēr Blue Bell pūlis joprojām pielūdz šo saldējumu, kas ir pilns ar mākslīgām garšām un HFCS.	27

Ak, TDS upuris, sapratu.	4
Kāda sūda atbilde	3,11

Tātad viņš ir puslīdz pieklājīgs. Prieks redzēt, ka jums beidzot ir kāda jēga.	15
[NAME] Es vēlos, lai tā būtu aktīvāka apakšgrupa :(	8
Ja neskaita maksimālo izvēles iespēju skaitu, katrs dalās, iespējams, tiek apkaunots internetā	27
Vienkārši aizņemies pret savu 401k, būtu stulbi to nedarīt. Ja vien neplāno doties pensijā ellē.	3
Šeit nesen atvaļināts policists. Man patīk šo redzēt. Tas ir tas, par ko viņš cīnās, lai to apturētu.	18

Tas ir kaut kas, ko bērni dara savās raustīšanās straumēs, lai iegūtu abonentus, un tas ir diezgan skumji.	25
Ak, es stipri saraujos	26
Katru reizi daudzi cilvēki mani pārņem. Man ir gaismas jutība pret fluorescentiem, tāpēc tas nepalīdz.	9
Kāds Obamacare sakars ar to? [NAME] atteicās no darba devēja mandāta, jo baidījās, ka [NAME] tas nepatiks.	27
Oho, jūs tiešām nevarat tikt galā ar zaudējumu, vai ne?	7,26

Prieks par to, meitene. 🥂	0,17

Kāpēc jā, tas dupsis ir nevainojams	0,4
esmu pabeidzis pārtraukumu, es apsolu vairāk	27
Nē, viņam viss kārtībā. Tas nav kompakts	27
Uz RNG balstīta piekļuve ļoti svarīgai mehānikai dažiem cilvēkiem ir nomākta.	3
Tas ir. Tas ir tik slikti. Tad es sāku vainot sevi par to, ka viņi man patīk. It kā es to nekontrolētu.	9
Taisnība.. bet tas tikai šķiet dīvaini, ka [NAME] varēja nomirt šajā troņa telpā, viņš tika nogalināts, pārgriežot uz pusēm.	27
Kā tad, kad totalitāri solidarizējas ar tiem &quot;normālajiem&quot; cilvēkiem? Ja tu piesaisti ANTIFA, tu neesi normāls.	27
Jā, es pastāvīgi dzirdu, ka tas ir lielisks un acis atverošs lasījums, tāpēc tas ir manā lasāmo lietu sarakstā. paldies 👍	15

Mēģiniet uzlabot savas mākslas prasmes! Kokapstrāde, koka dedzināšana, mozaīkas, vitrāžas, krāsošana uc Pārdod savus darbus!	27
Esmu tikpat liels iepakotāju fans kā nākamais puisis, bet tā mašīna ir neglīta lol	1
Es domāju, ka tas varētu būt tāpēc, ka esmu pārslogots ar atbildēm un ir salīdzinoši mazs personāls, kas iziet visas veidlapas.	27
Amerikas demokrātija ir vāja, bet tā nav mirusi. Ja jūsu komentāra nolūks bija atturēt cilvēkus no balsošanas, problēma ir jūs.	3,10

Tieši tāpēc es šeit ierados, paldies	15
Viņš faktiski neskrien 4,49. Tas ir nedaudz maldinoši, jo viņš ir diezgan viltīgs, tāpēc es saprotu, ka esat apmulsis.	6
Lūdzu, apgaismojiet mūs	27
es saņēmu automātisko atbildi pirms dienas	22
Man arī viņa patīk! Es ceru, ka viņai klājas labi un viņa paliks tālāk no [NAME].	18
Ko tu dari dāma	7
Liels tev paldies. Es to salaboju	15
Es jau spēlēju ar vienu draugu, un mēs saprotamies. Bet bija vēl viens puisis, ar kuru es iepriekš nebiju spēlējis.	27
Nē, paldies, iespējams, stnk af.	10
Kā cilvēks, kurš ir piesārņojis savu ķermeni ar lielu daudzumu cukura, es nedaudz šaubos, vai steroīdi ir sliktāki. Ļaunprātīgi lietojiet jebko, un tas jums nodarīs pāri.	2,11
. Es esmu puisis, tāpēc es lietoju miega zāles un meditāciju, nevis cieņu/godījumu pret vienu dienu.	27
Man jau patīk [NAME]	18
Man ļoti patīk šis gredzens, tāpēc priecājos to dzirdēt.	0,17
Man ir ļoti skumji, ka visa tā kūka tika izniekota.	9,25
oho, tas šķiet milzīgs ᴡᴀsᴛᴇ ᴏ- ᴡᴀɪᴛ ᴀ ᴍɪɴᴜᴛᴇ. ɴᴏ, ᴛʜɪs ɪs ɢᴏᴏᴅ	0
Labi rupji. Lūdzu, atstājiet [NAME] mierā un tur, kur viņš ir. Es esmu sakņojies par šo bērnu kopš viņa pirmās spēles.	27
Paldies :)	15
ikreiz, kad [NAME] tvītoja kaut ko līdzīgu, ir daudz lol revs cilvēku	1
Turi galvu augšā	27
Ja tincinot apkaisa, esi mīļš un noslauki sēdekli. #peetoo	27
... Man nešķiet, ka jūsu komentārs ir no objektīva viedokļa... Paldies tomēr.	10,15
Neesat pārliecināts, kāpēc [NAME] nepieļāva pārkāpumu, lai apturētu ātro pārtraukumu	27
*franču kanādiešu fuck. Viņi ir vienīgie, kas to izmanto, lai gan gandrīz ikviens franču valodā runājošais zina, ko tas nozīmē	27
Godīgi sakot, šobrīd man tikai jāzina, kāpēc mūsu lietotājvārdi ir tik līdzīgi. Haha...	1,7
Cik jauku atmiņu esat atradis. Ļoti žēl par tavu zaudējumu ❤️	25
Paldies dievam, ka vairs nesatiekos. Es negribētu riskēt ar kādu meiteni, kuru cenšos satriekt, redzot savu reddit vēsturi.	15
Jā, paldies [NAME] gudrākajam no [NAME], kas dzīvo ārpus jūsu valsts	15
Dam 😣 tas bija lieliski!	0
Jā, es uzskatu, ka šobrīd par to esmu parādā 13 000 USD.	4
Jūs man piešķirat pārāk lielu atzinību... Tas komentārs ir tikpat miskasts kā mēms	11
Vienkārši turiet pie rokas smidzināšanas pudeli ar berzes spirtu! Tas kausē ledu un nesasalst.	27
Oho, man tas ir jāpasaka, zinot 6600 S Harvard skaistas, lielas vecās mājas tur lejā!	0,26
&quot;Es nevarētu, es nevarētu&quot; tu to teici ;)	27
Vai tas nāk uz PS4 vienlaikus?	27
Nē, paldies, viņš jau ir pietvīcis	10
Godīgi sakot, viņa ieraksts bija nedaudz skumjš. Fakts, ka tas saņēma pozitīvu balsojumu, liek man vasarā izvairīties no šīs apakšgrupas.	25
Savā darbā es varu/daru daudz ko uzlikt, tāpēc otrais!!	4
Wtfffff kāpēc man nevar būt visas priekšrocības un nekādas sekas :( :(	7
Jā, tas bija nepiedodami	2
Izteicu vienu komentāru, un tu ienāci to nosaukt par bērnišķīgu..... piemēram, ko tu vēl dari, izņemot āpšus?	3
Cik dāsni :) tev tiešām viņi jāiepriecina. Labi jums par to	0,20
Paldies [NAME] par personu, kas gāja pa ietvi, pretējā gadījumā es uzreiz domāju, ka tā ir cilpa	15
Dziļas, izmērītas elpas parasti palīdz man atgūt mieru	27
Lol viņi ir tik pieķerti. “Tas nav tā, kā izskatās! Mēs ienīstam viens otru!”	27
Haha es pat nepamanīju. Es domāju, ka tā ir.	1
Paldies fam jam.	15
Jums būs simptomi vēl dažas nedēļas, kamēr tie sāksies, vēlu veiksmi, priecājos redzēt, ka jums klājas labāk	0
Omg patiesībā?! Es domāju, ka nav sprieduma, es vienkārši esmu SHOOK	7,26
Viņam patīk pirkt cilvēkiem alu. Viņš iesaistījās šajā nozarē, lai iegādātos cilvēkiem alu.	18
Nuh uh. Viņa negāja uz Gudžera koledžu.	10
Apvainojums arī dara. Mīlu [NAME], taču viņš tik ļoti aizskar mūsu atstarpes.	10,25
Jā, tu taču dzīvo klaunu pasaulē, pasmejies, deģenerējies.	1,4,27
Tiešsaistes spēles ir toksiskas. Ja šie samazinājumi kādreiz tiktu izmantoti, cietumā būtu daudz cilvēku.	10
Paldies. Es rīt (varbūt) piezvanīšu psihologam par zāļu palielināšanu, jo vienalga man ir zemākais līmenis.	15
KANĀDA! KĀ TAGAD IR?	13
Es šeit redzu vietu, kur es uzaugu :)	13

Tie nav izplatīti arī Apvienotajā Karalistē. Nekad neesmu redzējis vienu pa vidu.	27
Viņiem vajadzētu tikai tagad mums iedot kausu un ietaupīt visiem laiku	27
Es domāju, ka Bluey, iespējams, ir lieliskākie bērni, kādus es jebkad esmu redzējis. Tik raksturīgi Aussie, naglas ģimenes dzīvē, smieklīgi kā ellē. Mīlu to	0
Tas pasliktināsies, pirms kļūs labāk.	27
Vai jums ... ir sertifikāts, kas parāda, ka neesat ēzeļa smadzenes?	27
Kopumā jā, ja tas nebūtu tas, ka Classified būtu vislielākā lieta, kas nonākusi zombiju vidū kopš bo1, tad man būtu jāpiekrīt.	4
kāds zvērs	0
Mīli šo puisi, mīli šo komandu	18
Tieši brīdī, kad [NAME] bija liels gads, taču [NAME] šogad sagādāja lielu vilšanos.	9
Tas pat nav slikti. Dažiem cilvēkiem patīk tumšs humors, it īpaši, ja tas tiek pasniegts ļoti nopietni.	4
Atvainojiet, es skatos tikai sliktas anime	24
Man patīk šī komanda. Nē, es ienīstu šo komandu. Nē, es mīlu šo komandu!	2,18
Paldies par šo.	15
Jums ir talants, izmantojiet to, veltiet laiku, un jums patiks dažas pop bērnu melodijas utt. Abonenti noteikti ieradīsies	0
oho, šī ir normas maiņa, ko jūs pārņēmāt mēmu no Instagram uz reddit	26
[NAME] un [NAME] = varonis, kas mums vajadzīgs, bet ne varonis, ko esam pelnījuši.	0
Jā, tikai atpakaļ pie tā, kā tas bija iepriekš, bet šoreiz ar nelielu sabiedrības atbalstu, jo mēs visi esam dusmīgi par to	27
Draugs, šī ir atkārtota ziņa no [NAME], kuru varat redzēt, kad iedziļināties komentāros	27
Jauki izmēģināt māmiņu haizivi	0
Un ignorējot to, kā darbojas &quot;maģija&quot;, jūs atbalstāt savus argumentus.	27
Es joprojām neesmu pamanījis bērnu	10
Bet pa īstam. Piemēram, tālruņi, jūs, puiši. Vai man ir taisnība?	6
Padomājiet, vai [NAME] var augstprātīgi sazināties ar pieklājīgu fanu.	26
Arī man ir mani partneri virsū maniem bakalauriem? Ko nozīmē	7,27
Es, piemēram, priecājos par [NAME] izstāšanos. Tagad uzvarēsim šo spēli!!!!	17
Ja jūs domājat, ka visos ražotajos pārtikas produktos nav šo piesārņotāju, jūs diemžēl maldāties.	10
Vienkārši meklējiet viņu šajā grupā, jūs atradīsiet daudz informācijas, lai uzzinātu, kāpēc cilvēki tā domā. Man nav laika visu rakstīt	27
4 x nulles saķere joprojām ir nulles saķere.	27
Man patīk, kā viņš meklē karogu un sākumā nesvin	18
Šis ir ļoti acīmredzams joks. Arī vecā facepalm bilde nepadara tavu ierakstu labāku.	1,17
Palieciet gultā un noskatieties jaunu pārraidi, mans ieteikums Brooklyn 99	27
Kā iet! Es zinu, kas ir šis pāris! viņi izskatās patiešām laimīgi!	13,17
Viņš ir, bet viņš ir normāls. Pret 2/10 deju nodarbībā izturētos kā pret pāriju.	27
Ak, brīnišķīgās bažas, es patiesībā neienīstu [NAME], viņš tagad ir mans mīļākais spēlētājs Vegasā.	0,4
Vai jūs varētu paskaidrot, ko jūs domājat ar &quot;abām pusēm&quot;?	27
Omg es komentēju tavu sākotnējo ierakstu. Es ceru, ka jums klājas labāk, un es priecājos, ka tas viss iznāca un jūs esat beidzis.	13,20
Pa labi. Viņš pat neteica ne vārda. Man šķiet, ka es to esmu redzējis iepriekš.	22
Un mums apkārt būs draugi	27
Nākotne ir LIELA!	27
[NAME] labu minūti lol. [NAME] šovakar nemaz nevar sēdēt	27
Intersekcionalitāte sākumā varētu šķist dīvaina, taču tā patiešām ir labs ietvars, lai izprastu cilvēku individuālās cīņas sabiedrības aizspriedumu kontekstā.	0

Personīgi ļoti patika. Ievietojiet to manās 3 populārākajās maiņstrāvas spēlēs ar AC2 un Black Flag.	13,17
Vai kāds redzēja, ka [NAME] un [NAME] izspieda uzvaras rindā [NAME]? Es izplūdu smieklos!	1,7
Jūsu draugam noteikti ir bijis šausmīgs laiks, rakstot darbus, ja tādi īpašības vārdi bija aizliegti	27
Tas ir daudz sliktāk tbh	11
Klausoties viņa runas, ir patiesi aizkustinoši!	0
Es zinu pareizi. Tas jūtas ļoti labi, kad kāds atzīst jūsu esamību. Es ceru, ka jums pienāks vēl šādi brīži.	4,20
Skumji, bet amerikāniski	25
Kaut viņi būtu devuši gaisa transportlīdzekļiem kādu mīlestību. Daudzi ace piloti ienīda spēli.	8

Ne mazākajā mērā. Kurš būtu domājis, ka [NAME] izdarīs šo LMAO.	1
Oho. Vai tu teici jā?	7,26
Viņa atgriešanās vai viņa W2?	6,27
Vai pulveris nebūtu iegūts no kristāliskā MDMA?	27
Omg divas mazas segas tavam dzimumloceklim. MĪLU TO.	18
Man patīk, kā cilvēki negatīvi ietekmē, kad šādi ir notikuši tik daudzi militārie apvērsumi. Es aicinu tos, kuri balso negatīvi, pierādīt, ka man nav taisnība	18
Jā. Sestajā klasē zēns vārdā [NAME] tikko ar zīmuli iedūra man vēderā.	27
Oho, es atceros, ka bērnībā bieži ēdu šādu maltīti.	22
Oho, tas ir kā - skaņas pornogrāfija.	0

Es nedomāju, ka neviens no viņiem šo bumbuli izturēja sliktāk nekā otrs. Tas bija satriecoši.	11,26
daži cilvēki vienkārši vēlas uzmanību..lol	27
Tev taisnība... viņa ir viena no manām vismazāk mīļākajām personāžām. Es domāju, ka viņi daudzās epizodēs izmanto viņu kā īstu foliju.	18

Kāds IKP pieaugums? Tādu, kas kopš 1984. gada tik tikko izlauzās par 3–4% un ir samazinājusies līdz 1–2%, no 0 līdz negatīvam 1%?	7
Ak, es divas reizes pabeidzu RDR2, tāpēc nolēmu izmēģināt GTA V un vakar vakarā saskāros ar [NAME]! Lielisks raksturs!	0
Ak jā, inde. Jebkuras saindēšanās sliktākā daļa.	27
Pārsteigts, ka sarakstā neredzēja Three Arrows, kad 2018. gada laikā viņam vairs nebija videoklipu, un abonentu skaits pārsniedza 100 000.	26
Neatceros, viss bija ļoti miglaini...	9
Biedējošas lietas.	14
ES mīlu šo!!! Tu saprati!	18
Vai jūs domājat, ka bērns bija traks vai mamma bija traka? Vai arī jūs domājat, ka tas bija mazliet no abiem?	27
Bet viņš liek viņai vagīnai dziedāt! Kā gan citādi viņai būtu jārīkojas ap viņu. Haha	1
vai jūs esat galvenais iemesls, kāpēc es jūtos tāpat	27
Viņš bija daļējs īpašnieks, bet vai viņš arī veidoja videoklipus, kas reklamēja vietnes?	7,22
Man patīk tavs stils, negaidīsim, kad vēsturnieki palaidīs garām kādu iespēju.	18
Haskiji ir labāki par malamutiem, kas cīnās ar mani [NAME]	27
Vēderā badā, vēderā badā, vaļa vēderā badā	27
Viņiem bija līdzīgs panelis pagājušajā gadā. To noteikti ir vērts noskatīties.	27
Labāk ceru, ka neviens nenozags jūsu atslēgas	20
Kā ar maksām? Liela daļa no ātrajiem aizdevumiem ir nevis procenti, bet gan maksas.	7
tas tiešām ir labi	0
Ikreiz, kad redzu kādu staigājam ar savu mazuli, man tagad tikai liekas, ka *nabaga bardaks, viņam nav ne jausmas, kas notiks*.	27
ooohhhh, kad viņš skatās kamerā beigās, tas ir visskaistākais sūds	18,27
Bet es domāju, ka viņa jūtas rūpējas par to, ka viņš joprojām nav pietiekami garš, lai brauktu ar kādu no Disnejlendas amerikāņu kalniņiem.	5
Man patīk, cik nopietni un traki kaķi kļūst, kad suns sāk draiskoties ar viņiem visiem	18
Atvainojiet, tas ir skumji. Lietas kļūs labākas, tā vienmēr beigās	3,20
Ak, labi, tas ir saprātīgāk. Es nedomāju, ka lielākā daļa [NAME] redzētu jūsu uzvārdu un mēģinātu to padarīt franču valodā, lol.	10
Par to šaubies. Skins lietotājiem [NAME], [NAME] un [NAME] nemaina viņu spārnu formu, tad kāpēc tām vajadzētu lietot [NAME]?	6,7
Precīzāka, atbilstošāka karte	27
1.283 par komentāru bet es īsti netiecos pēc normāliem ierakstiem pēc karmas	27
Es noteikti tā ceru! Citādi esmu bijis nepareizajā apakšgrupā.	20
Jā, diemžēl izskatās, ka šis čempions būs diezgan nomācošs.	25
Tikai minūti... es kavēju GOLF!!	27
[NAME] ir vēl viens nevērtīgs [NAME]. Juta ir neticami stulba, ka par viņu balso.	27
Nevaru sagaidīt saas drāmu!!! 😂😂	13
Jā, es zinu, ko tu domāji. Bāc ar policiju, lielākā daļa no viņiem ir nelietīgi sūdi, viņi ir pelnījuši katru sitienu pa muguru, ko saņem.	2
Kāds pavērsiens.	26
Man īsti nav ko teikt. Ir slikta ideja, un tā ir pretīga.	10,11
Jums vajadzētu patikt trollis. Nesaku, ka esi.	10,18
Tikmēr mana māsa pat neapskauj manu atvadu, kad es viņu atlaidīšu skolā.	25
Viņa to dara vēlreiz pēdējās nakts epizodē, tas ir tik ēnains!!	3,27
Es noteikti redzēju tvītu, kur kāds iemeta savu skuvekli savā tualetē. Viņiem kādreiz tas būs jāizmakšķerē...	27
Tomēr tas nav bezmaksas. Tas ir smieklīgi dārgi.	3
Heh, nezinu, kā tas bija toreiz, bet es tiešām ieteiktu to pagriezt tagad - tas ir kā dzīvi patērējoši labi!	0
Tas ir acīmredzami nepatiess, ņemot vērā viņa vēsturi, kurā viņš ir iespiedis vairākus uzņēmumus.	10
Ir pienācis laiks moderatora lauka darbiem!	13,27
Diezgan pārliecināts, ka jūs to varētu izdarīt arī ar kravas kuģi, tāpēc es neesmu pārliecināts, ka es pērku šo argumentu.	6
Lietotājam [NAME] ir daži lieliski videoklipi par šo puisi. Viņš noteikti ir darbs.	0
Hahahahahahahaa (Atvainojiet, tas ir viss, ko varu teikt, tas neprasa saprotamāku komentāru.)	1
Daudzi programmatūras puiši ir. Avots: programmatūrā	27
Ak. Sasodīts.	3
Nedari tā.	27
[NAME] sasodīti hipiji	3
Haha godīgi. Tev paveicās :P	1
Esmu laimīgs, ka dzīvoju valstī, kur mačetes uzbrukumiem nav jāuztraucas.	17
Pagaidām konferences sezonas spēle un ESPN ieskrūvē straumi ar tikai saiti uz spēli spāņu valodā?	7
Vai tāpat kā mijiedarboties vienam ar otru, pavadot normālu vakaru? Atvainojiet, viņi abi ir tik traki.	24
Liels paldies! Es neesmu pārliecināts, vai tas ir tieši no youtube	15
Tagad tas TIEŠĀM ir sūdīgi	3
Izskatās, ka šis cilvēks tikko atrisināja pasaules bada problēmu. Sagatavojiet viņiem Nobela prēmiju!	0
Kaut es to būtu zinājis, kad mana kaķene pirms gadiem aizbēga. 😭	20
viņš vēl dzīvs?? vai viņš nenomira?	27
ŠAI BŪTĪBAI PAT NAV NOZĪMĪGA. PARAKSTS UZVARĒT. [NAME] SMARŽ PĒC sūdiem UN NAV PĀRSTRĀDĀTS.	2,11
Pfft, jums vajadzētu redzēt fortnite. Es zinu cilvēkus, kuri ir iztērējuši tūkstošiem dolāru lamām un ādām.	27
Tas būtu saistīts ar lasīšanu, un redhats tajā nav tik labi.	27
Tas mani ļoti iepriecina, paldies, ka padalījies!	15,17
Es tikai gribēju teikt, ka tas izskatās pēc viltus karmas.	9,25
Turklāt bērni dzīvo pie jums, un sieva var izvākties no ģimenes un atgriezties pie MIL.	27
Agrāk vai vēlāk jums abiem būs jāizdara izvēle attiecībā uz savām prioritātēm.	27
Paldies par jūsu pakalpojumu	15
*OH* *AH* *Ak*	13
Viņiem vienkārši ir labāk jātīra vannas istaba.	27
Es nedomāju Blizzcon, bet drīz pēc nedēļas, piemēram, tas būtu bijis labākais spēlētājiem un visiem iesaistītajiem	20
Sveiki, Nešvilas lauvu fani!!!	27
Viņš teica, ka seksistisks, nevis seksīgākais.	27
Lai nu kā, šobrīd šeit ir pulksten 00:33, tāpēc es iešu gulēt. Paldies par lasīšanu un ar labu nakti :)	15
Uz PS4 tas ir ļoti toksisks. Es domāju, ka tas pats ir arī Xbox One	27
Vai varbūt jūs sajaucāt Tag un Hide and Seek?	6,7
Godīgi sakot, varētu būt ātrāk vienkārši instalēt ublock ļoti ātri.	27
Nē, tas noteikti esi tu. Laiks tev izaugt.	3
Atvainojiet, ja par to ir ziņots daudz, bet kas notika lugā, kurā [NAME] guva savainojumu?	6,12
Sviesta bronzera-ārstu formula, un es NĪNĪS smaržu. Es ar to īsti neesmu spēlējis, bet wow, tik smaržīgs.	22
Es gribu noņemt aparatūru no tā puiša sejas ar knaibles.	27
[NAME] seko man pakalpojumā Instagram, tāpēc viss ir kārtībā.	27
Meitenes super-patīk?	7
Ar jaukāku cilvēku nevarēja gadīties.	25
Dažas tādas nav. Katrā ziņā tas ir noslēpums, kā viņi uztvēra tik daudz M1.	27
Viņiem pat to vairs nav, jo [NAME] pameta ballīti.	27
Noteikti ne tikai šajā apakšā. Es viņus turpinu redzēt arī Instagram.	27
Veiciet izpēti = klausieties anekdotiskus lietotāju pierādījumus (pilnīgi uzticami!) un izmēģiniet to, vienkārši esiet ērti!	27
Labs terapeits var likt jums runāt par to, par ko jums ir jārunā, kad viņš iepazīs jūs un jūsu emocijas un tendences	0
Idk, ja es kļūdos, bet es domāju, ka viņi viņai iedeva dažus pīrsingus uz auss, kas arī ir forši	4,27
Tiklīdz izlasīju virsrakstu, manā galvā sāka skanēt šīs spēles mūzika.	27
Mēs neesam demokrātija. MĒS ESAM VALSTS	10
Šodien vajadzēja kārtīgi pasmieties 😂	1,8
Es labāk nomiršu nekā braukšu ar Volvo!	2,10
mašīnas neieslēdzas, dažreiz mašīnas durvis aizsalušas ciet. tas ir sliktākais no tā, ko esmu piedzīvojis.	3
Lai veicas draugs. Es vēl neesmu sasniedzis savu robežu, bet tas mani tuvināja	0,5,20
Šie sasodītie bērni ar savu Rage Against the Machine un viņu niķošanos.	27
Tas ir absolūti vērtīgs	5
Lol, tas ir neticami! PLO ir tik pārsteidzoša spēle, kas ir daudz izklaidējošāka nekā NLH. Labs darbs draugs.	15
Izpakojiet to, izplatiet to apkārt, dalieties savā fatfobijā ar visiem!	27
Lol nē. Viņa man ļoti palīdzēja ar to tikt galā. Es teiktu, ka [RELIGION]/vecāki mani padarīja nožēlojamu	1
Jums tiešām nevajadzētu vienkārši glāstīt vilkus, kurus jūs zināt...	9
[NAME] gadu gaitā ir turpinājusi parādīt, cik egoistiska viņa ir. Par to mums nevajadzētu būt pārsteigtiem. [NAME] aizliedz viņai būt lielākajai personai bērniem.	9,22
Liels paldies par palīdzību &lt;3	15
Cik autistisks.	27
Jūs sakāt tikai citu bēgšanu, taču gandrīz garantēts, ka tas jūs izglābs un padarīs [NAME] drošāku par jebkuru citu slepkavu.	27
ES to novērtēju! Es pavadīju daudz laika, veidojot stāstu, kuru gribēju pastāstīt.	0
ak jā, neuztraucieties. Es novērtēju jūsu laiku un apdomību.	15
TAS MAN LIKA RAUDĀT	25
Šis ir visizplatītākais vidusskolas ieraksts, ko esmu redzējis šajā subredditā.	0
Ak, es zinu, lol, es pārcentos ar šo salīdzinājumu. Lieta tāda, ka dziedātājiem ir sūdīgi vokāli vakari, taču tas viņus nepadara par neprofesionāliem. Sūdi notiek.	3
Idk tā ir jūsu izvēle	27
Es varētu iedomāties, ka viņš drīz vairs nebūs, ceru, ka mēs varēsim viņam iegūt vēlu viduslaiku, piemēram, 5.	20
Man viņš patīk 1.tāpēc es piekrītu doties uz 2. un 3.randiņu, 2. mēs daudz rakstām. Es vienkārši eju lietas lēni.	0,18
&quot;Labi, mazais bārenītis [NAME], jums ir pienācis laiks šeit pelnīt naudu!&quot;	5,20
Jā, tas nav tik dramatisks un agresīvs kā bumba iepriekš minētajā videoklipā.	10
Es šaubos, vai man kādreiz piederēs kāds no tiem, es esmu grāmatu tārps un man patīk vecu grāmatu smarža. Paldies par informāciju, tomēr.	15,18
Lol, tu ej. Tur uz mirkli aizmirsu pārslēgties no altāra.	1
Es mīlu [NAME], taču izklausās, ka viņš apgalvo, ka līgumslēgšana ar 26 gadus vecu superzvaigzni ir muļķīga. Aiziet.	18
Tā ir viņa spekulācija vai informācijas noplūde?	6
Es dzīvoju pilsētas centrā un visu laiku staigāju neparastās nakts stundās. Patīk tukšā un pamestā pilsētas sajūta.	0,17
No tā sanāca labi pasmieties. Daudz sienu kauna materiālu.	1
FYI… [NAME] tās ir savā virtuvē “Tajā 70. gadu šovā”.	27
Dažiem no viņiem būs jāiegādājas jauni transportlīdzekļi, lai tie atbilstu prasībām. Tas nozīmē, ka mēs iegūstam tīrāku gaisu. Kur tieši ir problēma?	4
Satriecošs! Paldies!	15
Viņi nevar apiet rasu diskrimināciju, nesaskaroties ar nopietnu pretreakciju.	27
Cilvēce ir lemta	9,27
Droši vien valdied out cilvēks haha	1
Varbūt jums paveiksies, un tas izjuks, pirms viņi to pārdzīvos.	20
Viņam ir 38 gadi, un viņam vajadzētu doties pensijā. Es ceru, ka viņš vismaz tiks aizmainīts uz sāncensi	20
Paldies [NAME], viņa veica aprēķinus mūsu vietā	15
Jūs visi tam patiešām ticat, un es domāju, ka tā ir smieklīgākā daļa	1
Viņiem tik tikko tika dota iespēja	27
Ak, absolūti. Viņam nekādā gadījumā nevajadzētu kandidēt 2020. gadā. Tomēr es nezinu, kādas ir alternatīvas.	6,10
cik izplūdis ir šis fotoattēls/viegli satraucošs	3
Mēs arī to izdarījām, jo [NAME] šo spēli pārņēma vēlu.	4
Vienmēr domājis, ka [NAME] šķēps izskatās nāvējošs... it īpaši salīdzinājumā ar tādu personu kā [NAME].	27
Lol, es nevaru sagaidīt, kad kādu dienu varēšu nokļūt šajā apakšgrupā.	1
Un kāpēc lai es to darītu? Rediģēt: Paldies, ka izveidojāt šo Walder Frey līniju manā vietā	15
Sižeta pavērsiens: viņi nevēlas iet uz skolu	10
Ugunsdzēsēji šodien Lielbritānijā nopelna aptuveni 30 000 £.	27
2-4 minūtes nav pietiekami daudz laika, lai izmazgātu garus matus. 10-15 minūtes vismaz. Paliec stiprs!	5,22
Totāla puišu trijotnes nereaģēšana. Atkal ir [NAME]. Katru reizi, kad mēs šeit iznākam.	27
[NAME] un [NAME] Jocīgi ir tas, ka viņiem abiem bija arī strīds un viņi bija ringā vienlaikus	27
Tas nav veselīgs domāšanas veids. Acīmredzot šis puisis bija satraukts, un bez pienācīgas palīdzības viņš būtu darījis šīs lietas neatkarīgi no tā.	10
Ja vien jūs neesat tāds cilvēks, kurš ik pēc 3–6 mēnešiem maina attiecības kā pulksteni	22
Priecājos, ka neesmu vienīgā, kas bija pietiekami pedantiska, lai to pamanītu.	15
Vai tu esi dumjš...? Tāds ir un vienmēr ir bijis priekšlikums. [NAME] neklausās un vienalga. Sasodīts muļķis.	2
Jautrs fakts. Ja jūs apvienotu Ziemeļdakotu, Dienviddakotu, Vaiomingu un Montānu vienā štatā, tajā būtu aptuveni tāds pats iedzīvotāju skaits kā Puertoriko!	1
[NAME]. Domāju, ka tomēr ir strīds par to, cik bieži tas bija	27
Tas ir iemesls, kāpēc man nav draugu. Pat ne tievajiem, nekad nevar zināt, kā viņiem būs furūrā	27
iemācies vairs neteikt. Pēc dažām reizēm jūs esat iznīcinājis kaut ko, kas jums patīk, tas kļūst vieglāk.	5
Mans mīļākais ir urinēšana tualetēs, un jūsu kājas nevar pieskarties grīdai, sēžot uz poda.	27
Man patīk, cik pingvīni apstājās un gaidīja viņu 😍	18
labi? īsti nezinu, kāds tam ar to sakars. [NAME] izstrādā pārkāpumu, [NAME] vienkārši izpilda to	27
Izklausās, ka viņš melo jums abiem. Jums, iespējams, ļoti sāpētu sirds, ja turpinātu ar šo nodarbi.	27
Paldies, nākamais!	15
Rīt došos pie ārsta, lai pārbaudītu, vai viss ir normāli, un cerams, ka šis sūds ir tikai manā galvā.	20
puiši, jūsu sirdī ir naids	9,27
DAE ienīst nevajadzīgi sāļus cilvēkus, piemēram, OP?	27
Tas ir burvīgi! Viņš, iespējams, vēlas tos visus vienuviet, lai viņš varētu pārliecināties, ka viņiem viss ir kārtībā un ka viņi nepazūd vai netiek ievainoti.	0,5
Es domāju, ka jūs atklāsit, ka iepazīšanās ir patiešām sarežģīta poli vīriešiem. Tas ir lielākais iemesls, kāpēc es esmu monogāms.	4
Tas ir ideāls. Tu esi perfekts. Nekad nemainās.	0
&quot;Vai jūs esat radniecīgs?&quot; &quot;Nē&quot; &quot;Vai tu esi<more specific type of related> ?&quot;	27
&quot;Lol, tas ir Sammie Coates nomaiņa, nevis prāti uztveriet to, kā vēlaties, es esmu atpakaļ&quot; - [NAME] - AB	1
Acīmredzot viņi nespēja noticēt, ka liela korporācija (kurai viņi ir lojāli) beidzot viņus izsauca.	27
TAS IR TIK LABI. Paldies!!!	0,15
Neviens par to nav dusmīgs.	27
Meta kungs ir leģenda! Satriecoši. Tagad... Ja vēlaties runāt par naidpilniem talismaniem... The Phanatic atbilst šim mērķim.	10
Vēstulē es viņai teicu, ka viņa ir necienīga un ka mēs vairs nelūgsim viņu sēdēt mājās.	27
Tik patiesi! Manas smadzenes vienmēr iet uz šīm vietām, pērkot automašīnu...	4
Šis ir vissliktākais, ko esmu dzirdējis par ēdiena gatavošanu.	11
Prieks, ka viņš izdzīvoja, pretējā gadījumā tas varētu būt kļuvis par *mirušo* liftu.	17
&gt; Nav tā, ka obligāciju izmantošana būtu sliktāka vai kāds saraksts varētu atšķirties.	10
Nedaudz par vecu, lai nodarbotos ar skeitbordu	22
Es viņam to noteikti pateikšu. Paldies. Apsveicu, ka pats izrāvās no miglas.	15
Es parasti saku , NEKAUNS ! Viņi tevi vienalga nepazīst...mm	5
Tas ir kajaks	27
tas ir vienīgais, ko es atceros no šīs grāmatas	27
Kāds internets?	7
Vienmēr ir viens draugs 😂	1,4
Tas ir ļoti labs punkts, par kuru es nebiju domājis. Paldies dullais!	0,15
Vai viņš veda dzīvniekus?	7
Satriecošs! Ar nepacietību gaidu atjauninājumu.	0
Svīstot, viņam noteikti ir briesmīga smaka. Tas, godīgi sakot, ir diezgan rupji.	11
Nav R filmu vai TV šovu, nepērk no manis. Bet esmu pārliecināts, ka cilvēkiem ar bērniem tas patiks.	18
lol klasika [NAME]	1
Satriecošs! Laipni lūgti uz borta! Es priecājos, ka jūsu pirmā spēle bija uzvara!	0,15
Es lepojos ar tevi nejauši interneta svešinieks, tu šodien esi labs.	0,21
Tas izskaidro, kāpēc [NAME] varēja uzvarēt	4
Tas ir tik neglīts, ka man tas personīgi uzbruka, ko lai saka	3,9,11
Paldies par šo.😊 Man patīk apgūt jaunas lietas. #pieredze ir svarīga **Tovairākjūs zināt**🌈	15,18
Līdz nesenam laikam es nekad sevi neuzskatīju par bijušo [RELIGION], tāpēc daudzi nē.	22
Paldies	15
Es nekad neatgriezos pie amata, lai redzētu, vai tas ir BOA, bet es neesmu pārsteigts, ja tā bija. Tas bija mans pirmais minējums.	22
Man tas patīk. Beigas lika man raudāt laimīgas asaras. Es neraudu bieži	18
Tā ir līguma/pārdevēja vadības pozīcija vairāk nekā jebkas	27
Es tikko atnācu	27
Es tikko atradu savu jauno nojausmu. Paldies [NAME].	15
Jā. Viņš arī teica, ka tas notiks Menbidžas patruļā	4,27
Parasti viņi pat neparādās, kad jūs viņiem piezvanāt, un tie ir rets skats pilsētā. Lai veicas tādu atrast.	20
Ceru, ka visiem jauka diena.	20
Pietiekami godīgi, taču tas nenozīmē, ka viņa to nedarīs 2020. gadā.	4,10
Ak, es neapvainojos. ITA ar jums par pārējo.	10
Tās ir augstspiediena šļūtenes, padomājiet par ūdens dēli.	27
Es stāvu labots. Kā jau teicu, brīnišķīgas labdarības organizācijas. Es vienmēr izbaudīšu GDQ, tikai neņemot vērā manu pieredzi.	17
mans dievs beidz bloķēties	3
Šis. Šeit tas IR mazākums, bet viņi ir ļoti skaļi un ļoti aktīvi, tieši tas, ko jūs varētu sagaidīt no PR komandas	27
Tu esi* Paliec skolā lol	1
Es nezināju par [NAME], pirms redzēju šo sēriju. Es mīlu šo vīrieti un kopš tā laika esmu viņu skatījies neveselīgi.	9,18
Esmu pārliecināts, ka tas jums ir ļoti svarīgs jautājums, kas patērē jūsu ikdienas dzīvi...	27
Oho, piedod. Vai varat nofotografēt savus zilumus? Par ko viņa tevi mocīja?	27
Kuru daļu no &quot;Jā, bet tomēr&quot; tu nesaproti, vecīt?	6
Jūsu saite netiks ielādēta, un vai jūs nopietni minējat sasodītu Sīriju kā veiksmīgu piemēru kaut kam? [NAME] svētais, sasodīts knābis.	2,10
Viens no tiem ir netīrs kimono, kas valkā dīvaini	11
Neviens nevēlas, lai par muļķi noziedzīgi sodītu nepareizo personu	10
Vēlos arī norādīt, ka tas ir paredzēts apmēram 10 milj+ iirc	27
Es pilnībā domāju, ka šis mačs būs neizšķirts, jo [NAME] iejauksies. Man nekad vairs nevajadzētu izvēlēties pick&#39;em konkursā.	4
Lieliski, es nesen aizdomājos par debīli [NAME].	0
Es ienīstu tevi par šo titulu. Liels paldies. /s Pareizi, jo es arī grasos iet gulēt.	15
Oho. Aizmirstiet šķiršanos, advokāts un dodieties uzreiz uz šķiršanos.	26
Eh, būs labi. Vēl viena kaujas rēta haha. Veiksmi mums abiem!	1
Es nejūtos tik finansiāli nodrošināts	14
Draugs, tev ļoti patīk The Strokes.	4,18
Ironiski, ka &quot;uzvarētāji&quot; patiesībā ir zaudētāji (to viņi vēl nav sapratuši)	22
Jūs joprojām neatbildējāt uz jautājumu. Atvainojos, ka mani tas kaitina :)	24
Jo es esmu cilvēks un varu darīt visu, ko gribu, ja vien tas nav pretrunā ar likumu	4
Es nevaru iedomāties kaut ko smieklīgu, ko teikt, tāpēc balsojiet par to, lai dotu man bezmaksas karmu	10
Kā [NAME] tikko nodeva šo sitienu Attach, otrs spēlētājs bija tik tālu.	27
Neviens netiek cauri. Mēs visi mirstam. Tikai daži ātrāk nekā citi.	4,22
Tas ir lieliski! Un tā ir viņa paša izvēle, tu viņu nepiespiež.	0
Tik patiesi. Cāļi, ko es paņemu no klubiem, nav nekas, salīdzinot ar labas sievietes mīlestību.	4,18
100% pareizi. Ja nopietni, klausieties [NAME] runas punktus, kad viņa piemin Sīriju. Precīzi atbilst RT propagandai.	27
Es to nevaru....Es neprotu tiiik cieti vārīt olas	10,27
Ak, es tur nestrādāju. Mans bf ir grupā, kas tur spēlē bieži.	27
ES AR TERORISTIEM SARUNAS NEVEDU, to es ikdienā saku savam 3,5 gadniekam	27
Tas nekas, pirms GSE mēs darījām šausmīgas lietas ar kaulu miltiem dzīvnieku barību. Govis kanibāls.	21
Tie nav gluži sīki radījumi. Aizlāpi to caurumu, mans vecīt.	10
😂 Man arī tāda ir vajadzīga, es esmu pārtraukumā un godīgi sakot, mana dzīve šobrīd griežas ap reddit, kūku diena ir īpaša, izbaudiet to!	17
Es paspiedu roku, kas vienreiz paspieda viņa roku	27
Neskatoties uz to, ka viņi to ir rakstījuši tūkstošiem gadu.	27
Uh... Kas tev traucē to vienkārši izmest?	7
Esmu izmēģinājusi &quot;zemesriekstu sviestu&quot;...gandrīz vēmu. VĒRTĪGI! Tas nonāca tieši miskastē.	11
[NAME] būtu ļoti dusmīgs, ja pazaudētu c3po un r2 sasodītā iznīcināt galotnē	3
IX sērija acīmredzot ir par to, ka [NAME] atgriežas pie Jakku	27
Man ļoti patīk, kā šī komanda reaģē uz traumām	18
Viņa pretinieks ieguva DQ par [NAME] gaisa caurules noņemšanu. Viņa pirmais pretinieks ir iemesls, kāpēc [NAME] vispirms bija gaisa caurule.	27
Politika ir garlaicīga. Balso par visiem. -[NAME]	27
Aizvediet viņu uz ģimenes brīvdienām, un esmu pārliecināts, ka jūsu ģimene darīs visu, lai dotu mājienu, ka jums vajadzētu apprecēties.	27
Man patiesībā šķiet vieglāk novietot nārsta bākas tādās muļķīgās vietās kā šis, nevis jauku, plakanu, tukšu zemes gabalu.	4,27
Ja jūs nevarat redzēt, kā masveida muižnieku nogalināšana ir saistīta ar komunistisko ideoloģiju, tad īsti nav jēgas tālāk apspriest.	3
Es... neredzu tajā neko sliktu?	4
yikes	27
Franšīzes QB ir līderi, kas nosaka toni visai ģērbtuvei. [NAME] ir briesmīgs vadītājs.	0
[NAME] ATLIETS.	2
Es uzaugu dienvidos, un mēs visu laiku ēdām kastroļus. Tāpēc es dalos ar jūsu &quot;ko?!?!&quot;	27
Izņemot to, ka [NAME] joprojām turpināja ar laimīgām beigām, nevis beidza tās Aningaaq ainā.	17
Jā, tas ir gluži spocīgi; viņa pat nelieto šo sejas masku.	27
JUMS PATĪK BRUŅRUPUČI? Dodiet brīdi.	2,7
&quot;Tu nevari mani apturēt&quot; Ak jā, tie rotaļīgie vārdi, runājot par seksuālu darbību...	2
Jā, es arī par to nebrīnītos. Es esmu tik satraukti kaut ko redzēt vai dzirdēt.	13
Tā ir toksiska uzvedība. Atbrīvojieties no viņa pēc iespējas ātrāk.	3,5
Nebūtu šokēts, ja daudzi no šiem puišiem sekotu viņam uz TB.	26,27
[NAME]? Jūs visi [NAME] esat dīvains AF (un man tas patīk).	27
Nu, viņš apsolīja [NAME], ka tas ir beidzies, un viņš bija beidzies, vai ne. Tātad, nē.	27
Oho, tas ir pārsteidzoši, es ceru, ka mana situācija nākamgad būs tikpat laba.	0,20
Manam tētim patīk spēlēt sportu...... sporta veidu, kad slam dunking manu ass par piezemējumu	18
Oho! Tas ir lieliski! Apsveicam! Tas ir brīnišķīgi, ja ir cerība kādu dienu atbrīvoties no medikamentiem.	0,17,20,26
Es to izdarīju nesen un tagad manas kājas ir klātas ar ieaugušiem matiņiem &gt;.&lt;	27
Man ir tik žēl par [NAME]. Iespējams, bija grūti koncentrēties šim mačam, ņemot vērā lietas, kas notiek viņa personīgajā dzīvē	25
Jūs atzīstat sevi par sasniegumiem, ko neesat pelnījuši. Ne pirmā un noteikti nebūs pēdējā reize.	10
Man šodien vajadzēja šo. Paldies svešiniekam	15
Nāk uz dat golden state ass!	27
Es teicu sev: &quot;Tas būs refrižeratoru trakums&quot; Noklikšķināju uz saites, un tas bija Reefer trakums.	12
noskūts man noteikti padara lietu purvaināku. Man vajag matus, lai uzsūktu purvu	27
Es sāku dusmīgi, kad cilvēki, kas ir īsāki par mani, sūdzas, ka ir pārāk garš.	3
&quot;Šim droīdam ir slikts motivators.&quot;	9,11
Es izspēlētu šo spēli	2
Tas ir diezgan moderns. Tas tika atvērts 2007. gadā.	27
Jā, kad es to parādīju savam draugam pēc dažām minūtēm, es sapratu, ko viņš domāja, bet es aizmirsu noņemt savu ziņu.	12,22
Tie ir dažādi, tos sūdus nepiesien pie vājākās vietas, tie vienkārši paliek tur ar burvju palīdzību	2
Es nekad nezināju, ka raustīšanās var būt tik ...katarsiska.	12
Kolēģu lieta parasti ir uz labu, pārējam piekrītu.	0,4,27
Wtf, ja tā ir patiesība, tā ir smieklīgākā lieta, ko esmu lasījis visu dienu.	1
Mainiet savu domāšanu, lai negaidītu neko pretī, ja viņiem veicas lieliski, ja ne... viņu zaudējumi	8
Es tev piekrītu, es vienkārši neticu, ka tas notiks.	4
Jūs palaidāt garām būtību 🙃	3
Oho, viņš izvilka savu mazo krāpniecību [NAME]. Paskaidro, kāpēc viņš nevarēja izmantot jūsu ziņošanas rīku.	17
Es tikko šodien atjaunoju savu licenci, un viņi nepārbaudīja manu adreses apliecinājumu, tikai apskatīja manu ASV pasi, licenci un debetkarti.	22
Skatos tagad. Oho, mēs abi neapzinājāmies, cik ļoti mēs ienīdām šo puisi. Šī ir viena no visvairāk citējamajām epizodēm.	22
KAS UZVARĒJA ŠAJĀ CĪŅĀ Manas domas: neviena no pusēm nedarīja labu darbu, izskaidrojot savas pozīcijas, un visa šī intervija lielākoties bija bezjēdzīga	9
Paldies lol kāds cits tikko aizpildīja mani par backstory haha 😂	1,15
Labākā valdības forma ir 150 cilvēku cilts situācijā, kad nav ātrbojīgu preču, ir tikai ēdiens un drēbes.	27
Un viņi devās uz terapiju. Vismaz viņi aktīvi rīkojās, lai risinātu savas problēmas atšķirībā no daudziem citiem cilvēkiem.	0
Kāpēc GPL, nevis AGPL?	27
Neviens arī netur ieroci pie galvas, liekot viņiem moderēt sub.	27
Esmu patiesi priecīgs, ka viņš un [NAME] gūst panākumus	17
Es tikai saku, ka es neko nezinu. Es esmu tikai pērtiķu cilvēks uz akmens.	3
Meksika nesāka karu. Iespējams, tur jūs esat apmulsis. ASV abos gadījumos iebruka Meksikā, abos gadījumos Meksika tikai aizstāvējās.	27
Paldies Tev, paldies tev!	15
Kāda ir visu apsēstība ar jauno spēlētāju izmaiņu šajā apakšgrupā?	7
Es neieteiktu ar viņu sazināties. Tas, iespējams, viņu izbiedētu.	10
Audio uz RiF. Jums tas ir jāieslēdz manuāli	27
Es domāju, ka ir diezgan nomākta, ja kāds jums saka, ka debesis nav zilas	3
Jā, protams, bet tas ir pārspējams. Tas ir radīts, lai to sistu, nevis citādi. To es ar savu runu gribēju teikt.	4
Man patīk tavs mākslas stils, tas izskatās fantastiski!	18
Faktiski Bills pašreizējie formas tērpi liek viņiem izskatīties kā 1980.–1999. gada milži	27
Laipni lūdzam Pēdējo Dienu Svēto Jēzus Kristus Baznīcā, kur ģimenes var tikt ATŠĶIRĪTAS uz visiem laikiem	15
Man kaut kā atgādina plutona attēlu no NASA	22
Jūs zināt, ka tajā vispār netiek lietots vārds &quot;boikots&quot;, vai ne?	27
Man tā notiek visu laiku, es ļoti atvainojos 😣 tā vienmēr ir arī ar burgeriem. Tik sāpīgi.	25

BEN &quot;[NAME]&quot; LOVEJOY!	2
Puisis saprata izskatu	27
Nevaru izturēt to pundurismu [NAME], viņa ir tik satraukta	3
Es iesitu viņiem pa rīkli, pirms viņi saņem iespēju runāt.	2
Apsveicam! Smags darbs vienmēr atmaksājas! :) Ceru ka tev patiks jaunais darbs!!	20
Tas ir lieliski. Bet arī r/dontdeadopeninside	0
Ak, [NAME], tas ir tik neveikli	12
[NAME] un [NAME] ir mans mīļākais geju pāris	0,18
Jauki priekšnieki joprojām ir tikai priekšnieki, lai jūs izmantotu, lai arī liktu jums justies slikti, nevis baidīties, izaicinot viņus.	9
Ļoti foršas rotaļlietas, ļoti foršs video, ļoti foršs saimnieks	17
&gt; gadu desmitiem pēc Otrā pasaules kara, ieskaitot 1950. gadu. Ja vēlaties mani apvainot, vispirms izlasiet savu ziņu	2
Tās mr. Iztīri savu istabu. Šie puiši ir diezgan neatkarīgi, bet komentāri no cilvēkiem, kuri viņu mīl, izklausās kā makaroni	27
Mēģiniet valkāt kaut ko nepievilcīgu, kad skolēns ir blakus.	14,27
!remindme 7 mēneši	27
Tā pusceptā RP. Ja viņi gribēja viens otru nogalināt, viņi tikko sākuši šaut.	27
Paldies par uzmanību! Es jau kādu laiku to vēlējos redzēt.	15
un pīles formas uzgalis ļauj viegli aizsist veselas pudeles!	27
Es pametu biznesu, lai nekad neatgrieztos. Tad es satiku šīs vietas īpašnieku. Es mīlu šo darbu.	18
Viņam ir 60, un viņš nekad nav bijis HC koncerts. Tam vajadzētu uztraukties, ļaudis!	27
Kāpēc? Jūs varat man visu pastāstīt.	7
Man tiešām neviens no tiem līdz šim nav šķitis tik smieklīgs. Lai gan viņa atgriešanās un citas lietas ir diezgan iespaidīgas	0
Es tik ļoti gribu nirt ar akvalangu, bet peldēšana jebko, kas ir lielāks par baseinu, mani biedē.	14
Paskatīšos, vai varēšu atrast Atradu!	27
Man patīk, ka visi ir tik noslēpumaini par pierādījumu, kas viņus ir pārliecinājis	0
Ha ha ha, liels paldies, viņš ir pilnīgs džentlmenis. Ok, bullis pie ragiem laiks!	1,15
Tas ir rīks, ko idioti instalē, lai viņi varētu atzīmēt lietotājus, kuri publicē subredditos, kuriem viņi nepiekrīt, un nekavējoties samazināt vai uzbrukt šiem lietotājiem.	27
Smieklīgi, kā daži cilvēki kritizē cilvēkus par to, ka viņi neievēro šos likumus, kaut arī viņi to nedara.	27
Es ceru, ka jūs joprojām sūtīsiet viņai somu katrā Ziemassvētkos?	7,8
Man patīk, ka jūs redzat tikai šāda veida komentārus par japāņu spēlēm, izceļ iekšējo raudu.	18
Es politikā daudz neiesaistos, bet, ja viņi vēlas atbalsoties, atstājiet viņus mierā, tas viņus nemainīs, viņi tikai kļūs dusmīgāki	27
Mēs nezinām, kas būtu noticis, ja viņa būtu teikusi nē, tāpēc lielākā daļa puišu nejautātu.	6
Neuztraucieties, [NAME] ir tur.	5
es tiešām smējos par to lol labo vīrieti	1,17
Viņš domāja, ka, ja komiķis izjokoja tieši par savu vectēvu, nevis kādu vecu vectēvu, tas ir personiski.	27
Man arī tie ir, vai ir kādi padomi, kā tos noņemt/padarīt mazāk pamanāmus?	27
&gt; tie, ko tev ielikuši cilvēki, kuri tevi audzināja, man tas patīk. Tas ir ideāls tēls.	0
Es izdarīju kaut ko līdzīgu pirms gandrīz 2 gadiem un saņēmu 67 pozitīvas balsis, pirms man tika aizliegts	27
Man nav nekas pretī ziņojumiem, kuros ir nosodīts NOED vai DS. Bet es vēlos, lai šim būtu jēga vai būtu smieklīgi.	8
Atvainojiet. Es zinu, ka man jābūt pateicīgai un laimīgai.	24
Tas ir tik forši!	0
Oho, paskatieties uz šīm dziļajām kabatām, kas ēd lēcu dienā, man ir jāsagriež savējais, lai man iztiktu mēnesi!!!	0,26
Man patīk šī vispārējā joma. 203.–205. sadaļas ir labas sadaļas visā cenas un skata ziņā	17
Vai jūs pārbaudījāt bļodu?	6,27
KNC ir [NAME] Sīrijas politiskā partija un KRG izpausme, tāpēc jā, netieši.	27
Es domāju, ka daudzi dzīvnieki, kurus esmu redzējis, baidās no parastajiem izbāzeņiem, iedomājieties, ka jūsu bailes ir tik lielas	14,19
Vai es pasniedzu braiwashing sektu kā kaut ko pozitīvu? Abi ir slikti, bet vismaz jūs varat izkļūt no emo terapijas.	10,22
Te tāpat. Es vienkārši nesaprotu, kā NEVIENS no Lucasfilm ražošanas laikā teica: &quot;Hei, varbūt šī ir slikta ideja.&quot;	6
Viņi ir snieguši daudz pierādījumu, kurus jūs līdz šim esat tikai atbalstījuši.	4
Labi. Es ceru, ka viņam ir laba sieva un viņai viss ir kārtībā, ja viņam būs jāmaksā sods.	20
Atsvaidzinoši šeit ik pa laikam neredzēt komentārus ar pret Ķīnu vērstiem noskaņojumiem.	27
Sphh, tas bija traki. Es saku, ka gāja labi.	27
Argumentēt vārda argumentu semantiku. Gudra meitene...	0
Ja nopietni, es to ķēru un mīlu kopš tā pirmās iznākšanas.	0,4,18
Nebiju gaidījis šo sūkļaboba atsauci	10
Es nepavisam neuzticos mūsu aizsardzībai. Es neticu, ka jūs varat palielināt Andujar diapazonu.	26
Tajā pašā laikā, ja kameras kvalitāte ir tik slikta, varat būt pārliecināts, ka arī mikrofons ir tāds.	27
Meth un alkohols.	27
Man patīk, kad bērni izslēdz šīs nogurušās rindas, ar kurām mēs, pieaugušie, viņus barojam. Droši vien viņai tas bija vajadzīgs. Labi padarīts.	18
Pema Bīslija un Džims... Kāda izšķērdība.	3
Viņi dzīvoja labu dzīvi! Es viņus godāju, izmantojot visas viņu daļas	0
Es domāju, ka tas bija vairāk saistīts ar nevēlēšanos sāpināt veco vīru. lol	1
Banāns runā! Vai komentāros ierakstāt tikai vienu līdz trīs vārdus, vai arī, ja izvēlēsities četrus, rodas vesela skaitļa pārpilde?	7
Es arī neraudu. Tas ir dīvaini. Es domāju, ka tā ir personības/mentalitātes lieta. Tas ir atkarīgs no tā, kā jūsu smadzenes ir savienotas, manuprāt	22
Ak nē, tas ir tik neērti, es nesaprotu, kā cilvēki nesaprot, cik dīvainas ir tādas lietas!	12
Cik es atceros, viņai bija ļoti stipras hroniskas muguras sāpes, tāpat arī pati ārstējās ar alkoholu	27
Ak [NAME]...	27
Tu sajukušais burvis, man tas patīk.	18
dīvains veids, kā uzrakstīt Boys Don&#39;t Turbo Grafx 16	11
Priekā, draugs! Es zinu, ka tu to vari! :)	20
K... Es domāju, ka es pieņemšu tavu darbu par to.	4
Tas bija ne tikai patiess, bet arī patīkami skatīties.	22
Es zinu, ka viņam ir daudz bagāžas, bet es droši vien dotos ar [NAME]. Paskatieties, ko viņš izdarīja [NAME] labā.	27
Man nav kailuma, tāpēc es to nedarīju NSFW, bet es saprotu, kāpēc jūs tā sakāt. paldies par komplimentu	15
Nopietni. Vienīgais, kas to atdeva, nebija pareizrakstības kļūdu.	3,27
Tās vienmēr ir manas lielākās bailes, kad rodas doma doties prom janvārī. Es novēlu jums veiksmi to atkausēšanā!	11,14
Viņš izskatās tik gudrs.	0
Ohh lol, rupji un smieklīgi	1
&gt; Apģērbs ir bijis agrāk nekā reliģija. Vai varat to minēt? Šķiet, ka tas ir diezgan interesants jautājums.	7
Jā, es vairāk saprotu viņu apjukumu, bet jā. Man atgādina [NAME] haha.	1
Jo nepievilcīgāks šobrīd izskatās vadītājs, jo pievilcīgāks izskatīsies jaunais 2020. gadā	27
Es dotos uz [NAME]. [NAME] tiek grābts par katru kļūdu, ko es iemetu personīgi	27
Es vienmēr esmu atradis tos rīvētus	3
diemžēl, lai kādreiz mainītu aizbildnības līgumus, būtu vajadzīgs vairāk nekā šis. Tomēr dokumentēt to viņas pašas saprāta labad ir laba ideja.	25
Bija TIK grūti noklikšķināt uz šī poga. Tas ir viens no tiem &quot;Es to ienīstu. Labi darīts&quot; brīžiem.	2
hahahaha!! konkurējošās koru pasaules noslāpētais vēders - atklāts!!	1
Lol, varbūt viņš nav, bet es domāju, ka mana doma joprojām pastāv 😄	1
Viņiem bija jāievieto frāze &quot;pārmērīga apkope&quot;.	27
Jā, tas nav viens un tas pats dziedātājs. &#39;Neapskauj mani, es baidos&#39; izbalso [NAME], KKB solists ir [NAME]	4,22
Mans labākais draugs arī nokavēja izrādi, izmantojot tualeti. Viņš domāja, ka starp 4. un OT bija puslaikam līdzīgs pārtraukums.	27
Velns, jauks bloks [NAME]	0
Tas ir pārsteidzošs. WTF.	26
To chelsea padome zinās un ienīst.	3
Visa šī epizode ir viena no manām mīļākajām; tajā ir šis UN &quot;Rekviēms otrdienai&quot; UN &quot;Zema kaloriju kalzona zona&quot;	18
Skaidrs, ka ne Cubs fani.	10
Tad nekautrējieties izveidot saiti uz šiem datiem, nevis uz politiku.	27
Pie velna, es piekrītu ☺	4
Viņš vēlas būt brīvs, lai varētu sist citām sievietēm. Varbūt viņš to neņems tālāk, bet man tā šķiet.	27
Es šaubos, vai cilvēki ir *laimīgi*, taču viņi, iespējams, nav skumji par kādu, kurš potenciāli apdraudēja citus ar saviem pretzinātniskajiem uzskatiem.	25
Kāds citāts. Ļoti uztverošs.	0
Priecājos, ka varēju sniegt kādu pozitīvu ieguldījumu! Visu to labāko jums un jūsu bērniem!	15
ES mīlu šo; Tagad, kad komisti saka, ka viņiem vispirms bija vārds &quot;libertarian&quot;, mēs varam teikt, ka mums vispirms bija klases analīze!	18
Tam ir jābūt jokam...	1,26
Kad viņi viņu pieņem darbā	27
Seksīgi zobi.	0
Ja policisti viņu arestēja, viņam jābūt vainīgam! (Lai veicas! Jūs to sapratāt!)	27
viņš pameta uzņēmumu pirms 2 gadiem. viņš nav iekļauts mātes uzņēmuma akcionāru sarakstā.	27
Kāda drūma statistika Kanādai.	0
Un es vienkārši sēžu šeit, vēloties, lai mans kaķis atnāktu vismaz apsēstos pie manis.	27
Es vienkārši gribu dzīvot. Tu esi skumjais zaudētājs, ka izteici savu viedokli par kaut ko tik stulbu	2,3
Es gribu mirt, es negribu vairs dzīvot	25
Man tu izskaties tāds pats, bet es priecājos, ka tev bija mērķis un tu to sasniedzi!! Tu esi jauka!!	0,17
Nē, tā ir mīlestība.	18
Lol, es īpaši neiebildu pret grupu projektiem, es to darīju tikai tad, kad klasē nebija draugu.	1
Un te es domāju, ka animācija pēc padošanās/Uzvaras ir kaitinoša ;-;	3
Es skaidri atceros, ka man teica to pašu 97. gadā, kad es braucu ar 74. gadu... izņemot gadījumus, kad gadi bija atšķirīgi.	27
Es patiesībā tā daru	27
Protams, bet ziņu raksts ar [NAME] pazušanu ir bijis tur jau no paša sākuma.	4
TU KĻŪSI RESUNS!	27
es teicu pirmā pasaule :)	27
Xers un [NAME] būtu vairāk vecumā 90. gados, parakstījušies [NAME].	27
Varbūt tā. Vai man mēģināt viņai par to pajautāt? Es uztraucos, ka tas viņu tikai vairāk nobiedēs	14
Vai tas esi tu, [NAME]?	7
Es domāju, ka &quot;Corporate Stooge&quot; fokusa grupai nebija labi.	27
PCD pogas. Es nekad nepārstāju spēlēt šo dziesmu 2006. gada vasarā.	27
#RejectingIslam, jo tieši *idejas* [RELIGION] veicina mani no tā.	22
kautuve = kautuve	27
Cik tuvu es biju saglabāšanai pagājušajā gadā	27
Turas pretī. Tie, kuriem ir vislielākā nūja (ierocis) un viss...	27
Vairāk camo bikses!	27
Vai vārdus atbloķēja?!	7
Es noņemu šo ziņu avotu iegūšanas dēļ. Izlasiet sānjoslu.	10
Izlasi vēlreiz viņa ziņu. &quot;Tas ir vairāk balstīts uz faktiem nekā Fox.&quot; Atvainojiet, bet jums var būt dažas papildu hromosomas.	24
Paldies, ka pamatojāt manu atbalstu Tulsi, Daily Gross.	27
Ahhhhh, tev jāsāk kliegt un klaigāt. Kāds slikts arguments. Tagad es ticu neredzamiem pūķiem.	10
Nē, viņam ir taisnība, un jūs novirzāties no viņa argumentiem.	4
Tas ir stulbi	3
kāpēc es brīnos?	7
Ej, kāds puisis...	27
Tikko noskatījos ET interviju un tiešām bija laba! Patīk šī kapuču stratēģija, haha	0,18
Viņš netika pārspēts visu sezonu. Manuprāt, garākā piespēle, ko viņš atļāva, bija aptuveni 20 jardi.	27
Pielāgojies un pārvar	5
Tas ir atkritumi. Nē. Maniem atkritumiem ir lielāka kompozīcijas vērtība nekā šim. Hipster pepto bismol vemt izskatās trash.	11
&gt;tfw viņa viņam skaidroja, ko darītu kodolsprādziens	22
Šovakar došos uz savu iecienītāko trekno burgeru vietu Medisonā, lai atzīmētu savu spēju ēst garšīgus burgerus, kad vien vēlos, jo man ir 20 gadi.	17
Es joprojām uzskatu, ka iepakotāji šogad bija sliktāka komanda.	9
ES mīlu šo. Es ļoti vēlos tagad apskaut [NAME].	18
Viņi to sauc par centrmezglu un spieķu sistēmu. Viņi neņēma vērā riteni.	10
Man vienmēr dzimšanas dienā atgādina radinieki, jautājot, vai man vēl ir draudzene. Atvainojiet, brāli, es joprojām esmu ārpus sociālās normas.	25
Nē, viņš tikai iestata attēlu. Viņu atbalsta PS, lai spēlētu šo turnīru...	27
&quot;Paldies, ka parādījāt man savus sarkanos karogus pirmajās 10 mijiedarbības sekundēs.&quot;	15
Es dzīvoju Kenterberijā, haha	17
tu valkā galvas saiti, kāda tu esi meitene? /s	27
Laimīgi kopā. Tas jūtas tik dabiski.	17
Paldies par skaidrojumu, novērtēju to.	15
Es vienkārši nāku ārā un atzīstu to. Ietaupa no vilšanās.	27
Manuprāt, [NAME] to teica vislabāk. Kad divi cilvēki skatās vienu un to pašu videoklipu un redz pilnīgi atšķirīgus notikumus... to nevar labot.	0
Izskatās pēc vārītas olas.	4
Priecājos, ka es mēdzu ievietot savus kaķu attēlus, nevis sevi.	17
Es nedomāju, ka WI ir liesa sarkana, pēc 2018. gada es iebilstu par to, ka tas ir vai nu tossup, vai liesi zils.	10
Vai viņš ir tavs avots?	7
&quot;ES arī. Viens no tiem ir Hulu.	27
&quot;Es esmu šeit stīgu dēļ&quot; Man patīk šis.	18
Man bija aizdomas, bet es negribēju lasīt tik civilizētu godīgu aktieri.	7,10
Vienmēr ir patīkami pateikt kaut ko [jauku]!	15,17
Ak velns jā	2
Dam zēni, mēs paziņojam, ka spēlētāji atgriezušies treniņos kā jaunus parakstus!	4
Tie ir ļoti stingri rakstīti, tāpēc tas var būt neētiski.	4
Neuztraucieties, paldies par atbildi! Rotary nozīmē, ka jūs mācāt vienu priekšmetu un redzat dažādas nodarbības, nevis mācāt vairākus priekšmetus vienai klasei :)	15
es to tik ļoti izbaudu	17
Man šķita, ka V spēle bija lieliska, taču lielais varoņu slēdzis, ko neviens neprasīja, to patiešām aizkavēja.	22
Visu laiku sliktākais tētis!	2,9,11
Vai vienkārši pavadiet desmit sekundes pie ugunskura un saprotiet, ka ir ļoti karsts.	22
Tā darbojas femboy	27
Viņam jau bija grūti, kad es ienācu	27
Ielādes ekrāna apakšā ir aplis, kas turpina griezties. Es mēģināju atinstalēt lietotni, un arī tas nedarbojās.	9
Nav īpašas mērces, esmu noguris no tā, ka man ir jāmeklē tas mazais pannas plankums vismaz 2 minūtes, pirms es to atrodu.	19
Man ne mazākā mērā nepatīk [NAME], bet es ienīstu [NAME] vēl vairāk. Iegūstiet viņu Belcalis	2
Izmet viņu ārā. Pāraudzis mazulis.	2
[NAME] izskatās ļoti nervozs	27
Tā ir kā mākslas skola, taču visur tiek mētātas bīstamas, viegli ierocis burvestības!	14
Tautas cilvēks....	27
Tā izklausās pēc atbilstošas atbildes. Paldies, ka ietaupījāt man laiku.	15
Vai nebūtu vieglāk atrast 10%, tad reizināt ar 2?	6,7
Smieklīgā daļa ir tāda, ka siena NAV (bet varbūt vajadzētu būt), un jau ir daudz &quot;saprātīgu&quot; ieroču likumu	1
Es to daru, bet galu galā jūtos labāk, jo izmantoju to atlikšanai. Tā ir dīvaina kombinācija, lai tīrīšanas laikā justos labāk un sliktāk.	2
Es jau iepriekš esmu strādājis sūdīgā dienvidu pusē dūmu veikalā, tāpēc varu lieliski iedomāties visu šo mijiedarbību hahahaha	1
Ja Studio MDHR to darītu, es to pirktu.	20
KAMALA 2020!!!!!!!	27
Tādas muļķības. Vai iekļautas komponentu atkārtotas ielādes? Ne tas, ka viņi ļautu tam pastāvēt nākamajos likumos, ja tā ir.	2
Paldies, es to novērtēju. Ar to bija un joprojām ir grūti tikt galā.	0,15
Tagad jūtos nedroši	19
Liels tev paldies. Es atvainojos par to, kas ar jums notika.	15,25
Oho, jūsu bijušais partneris izklausās tieši tāpat kā manējais.	22
Atrada savu nojautu.	17
tas ir tik smieklīgi, kā šīs apakšgrupas modifikācijas uzvedas salīdzinājumā ar šīs apakšgrupas modifikācijām	1
Pajautājiet viņam, vai viņš apsvērtu iespēju atvērt kosmētikas veikalu, ja jūs viņam iedotu 6000 USD	27
tikko sapratu, ka bilde kaut kā nav saistīta. lepojos ar mani, neskatoties uz manu satraukumu par putinu pats vai tur	22
Pēc vairāk nekā 100 stundām esmu sapratis, ka no zirga var nokāpt, nenolecot	22
Ja mirst pārāk daudz medicīnas darbinieku, dzīve kļūs sliktāka, jo mēs nevarēsim saņemt medicīnisko palīdzību	10
Aha paldies!. Es nezināju, ka ir kāds	15,22
Mums bija 3 veselas paletes ar šo vienu lelli, un es esmu kā &quot;wtf&quot;, tāpēc es pārbaudīju, un atrašanās vieta teica 8000 kaut ko lmao.	3
Beidz pievērst šim idiotam uzmanību.	3
Kaut es būtu tik laimīgs	8
Lai turpmāk veicas ar rakstīšanu :D Katram ir jābūt saviem kritiķiem...vai ne?	20
Tas pat nav viņa nedēļas notikums. Tas ir pēdējo desmitgažu spilgtākais notikums. Nolādētie sīpoli.	0
O, jauks brālis	4
Sveicināts, taisnstūra biedrs, kura stūrī ir smails bits.	15,27
Pārāk daudz fuuuck	2
Interesanti, kāpēc viņi to maina	6
Ok, esmu medības, paldies	15
Tā kā viņi ienīst policistus un mīl noziedzniekus... tas viņiem der	4
lai tie sasodīti slinkie tūkstošgadnieki ātrāk atrod darbu /s	27
Es nekad nedarītu tik plašu vispārinājumu. Tipiski honkies, pieņemot lietas	3
Kas ir populisms? Pēdējā laikā esmu to daudz redzējis, un šķiet, ka, cik es varu pateikt, nav nekādas nozīmes.	6,7
Manuprāt, neviens no viņiem nav slikts režisors. Tomēr viņi abi ir slikti rakstnieki.	10
Kā [NAME] es atvainojos par trakajiem vecajiem konservatīvajiem, kuri, iespējams, šobrīd izsaka smieklīgi neinformētus komentārus par jūsu valsti :/	25
Tā nabaga čūska	27
Cik daudz pārsteiguma Pikaču mēmu mums būs šajā epizodē? Tāpat kā 6?	7
Pagājušajā mēnesī es redzēju stāstu par dāmu, kura bija tik liela, ka nogalināja savu draugu ar saviem taukiem vai kaut ko citu. Es domāju, ka tāds ir viņu plāns.	27
Uh, mīlēts un pazaudēts, noteikti. Es vēlētos vismaz vienu patīkamu atmiņu, uz kuru atskatīties.	18
Viņi nozaga manu joku, sasodīti!	3
Vienkārši paturiet to. Jūs cietīsit vairāk smadzeņu bojājumu, nekā tas ir vērts.	27
Atvainojiet, ka manas komandas tev šosezon pieļāva tikai divus zaudējumus ;)	24
Daži kolēģi domā, ka [NAME] uzņemsies izaicinājumu ar diezgan lielu piepūli. Neviens nedomā, ka tas izdosies, kamēr nenotiks masveida notikumi.	27
Kāpēc fuuuhhh	2,27
kā ar [NAME]?	27
Veiksmi!	20
Sliktākais ir tad, ja atrodat to vietā, par kuru zināt, ka skatījāties pirmais.	27
Skatiet citas manas atbildes	27
Viņš ir gudrs sneck	0,27
Ikviens zina, kā es varu noskaņoties. Nemaksājot par Blaze TV abonementu. Šis būs labs.	7
Es haaaaate vaniļas smaržas, un tās man ir 100% NOPE. Es valkāju neitrālus/koka aromātus, un puisim tas patīk, tāpēc uzvariet.	2,18
Ja mēs nevaram slēgt šāda veida spēles mājās, mēs neesam pelnījuši izslēgšanas spēles.	4
Es teikšu, ka viņas mājokļa rēķins man atstāja ļoti sliktu garšu, un to saka kāds, kam ir ļoti augsts viedoklis par [NAME].	11
Jā, jūs varat iet apkārt, ietriecoties lietās, sabraukt cilvēkus un pilnībā atbrīvoties no tā.	4
Jūs to teicāt, mazulīt, nevar gaidīt, lai redzētu, kādus brīnišķīgus brīnumus nesīs atlikušais 2019. gada gads!	7
Nevarēja vairāk piekrist	10
Like wtf kā tas leņķis ir 114 grādi	7
Man būs viens priekšā un otrs aizmugurē. Lūdzu un paldies!	15
Burtiski ieradās pagājušajā nedēļā solo. Varat izmantot Hellotalk, lai satiktos ar cilvēkiem vai dotos uz saviesīgiem pasākumiem	27
Mums patiešām ir jāpieturas pie noderīgiem nosaukumiem vai ātras tldr.	22
Protams, mums pirmdzimušajiem ir jāturas kopā. ❤️	4,18
Tas skar smagi, diemžēl abas manas attiecības ir bijušas toksiskas, tāpēc esmu nolēmis nesākt jaunas, kamēr nesāku iet augstskolā.	25
Šis!!! 🐃 un 💍 par jūsu smago darbu!	0,13,27
Vai tas iet uz augšu? Šķiet, ka vēl 90. gados bija 16.-17.	27
Bērni vairs nevar izklaidēties...:(	9
VIŅAI JĀBŪT KURŠ KALNĀ, AR SAULE UN MĀKOŅI VIRS VIRS!	27
ES ESMU MR. [NAME]! KĀ MĒS TO IEDARĪJĀM?	7
Vai kādam citam šķiet, ka [NAME] bija ģērbies kā [NAME]?	7
ASV labklājības izdevumi ir diezgan zemi uz IKP, salīdzinot ar pirmās pasaules valstīm. Drošības tīkli ir smieklīgi vai vispār nav, un nevienlīdzība ir smieklīga...	2,3
Dzīvo apmēram 2 minūtes no turienes. Patīk skats uz Waramaug no Tanner Hill.	18
Labi darīts OP, ka rīkojies pēc taviem vārdiem. Es ceru, ka jums būs lieliska diena kopā!	0,20
Kāpēc? man tas patīk.	18
&gt; Tas noved pie pieskaršanās un nepiedienīgu lietu darīšanas ar pretējo dzimumu. Es dodu priekšroku vienam dzimumam, vai tad šīs lietas nav man nepiemērotas?	6,7
Jūs īsti nestrādājat TSA, ja viņi jums nemaksā. Tu esi vergs. Ej mājās.	2
Tas ir šokējoši, vai ne? Es maksāju mazāk par lidojumu no Londonas uz Mančestru, nekā tas būtu maksājis par vilcienu.	26
Labi, tagad jūs apzināti nepareizi interpretējat to, ko es saku. Vienalga.	27
Mani tas vairāk uztrauc, nejauši sakot tēti pāri augšai... It kā tas ir normāli	14
&gt;!Es vienmēr pieņemu, ka Motoyasu komanda mainās reizi nedēļā vai kā.!&lt;	8
Vēl neesmu noskatījies, draugs. Tu?	27
gaisa padeve? dzīves ironija	27
jā, tas labi neatspoguļo mūsu fanu bāzi. gg puiši!	27
&gt; Parasti tā tiek uzskatīta par vienu no sliktākajām [NAME] spēlēm, kas jebkad radīta. Nē, tā nav. Apgalvojuma avots.	10
Mana māja. Neskaitot to, ka tā bija bankas nauda, šogad plānojam maksāt skaidrā naudā par virtuves remontu, kas būs aptuveni 7k	27
Grūti izskaidrot, man šķiet, ka viss ir tālu.	25
Uzslavas. Labi darīts.	0
Nē, vairs nav NEXT! Viņi acīmredzami ir tikai bērns, kurš ir sajūsmā par mūzikas atklāšanu. Dodiet viņiem pārtraukumu! :/	10
Metro ir visgudrākais risinājums, ja vien jums nav līdzi ņemamu preču!	0
Viņš tiešām ir labs.	0
Tas bija šis, šķiet, tas bija uz visiem laikiem atpakaļ. Es izdzēsīšu šo ierakstu, ja kāds tā saka.	27
* jā * jā * jā * jā	4
Man šķita, ka mums nav paveicies, jo nācās samierināties ar [NAME]. Cilvēk, jūs, puiši, saņēmāt īso salmiņu ar nindzju.	27
Tas ir lieliski! vai jums ir vēl kādi mākslas darbi kādā tīmekļa vietnē vai sociālajā vietnē? Vai šis ir pārdošanā!?	0,7
Vai jūs vakar vakarā redzējāt šo smieklīgo displeju?	7
Bezmaksas zāle lol nesaprati, par ko sūdzies.	1
Nevaru sagaidīt.	13
Es nevaru sagaidīt, kad redzēsim, ko mēs, kvalificētie darbinieki, iegūsim. Paldies valdībai par to, ka teicāt uzņēmumiem, kā vadīt un strīdēties ar nekvalificētiem darbiniekiem bez ambīcijām.	13,15
Jauka šautene. Man ir T3 7mm rem mag. N Mine būtu kā SHTF šautene, taču tā ir lieliska medībām.	0
Tiekamies rītdien FIN - ASV! Vakara beigas iguāna	20,27
Es izmantoju zvanu skrīningu savai māsai, lai pasmietos.. viņa nebija tik uzjautrināta kā es :)	9
Es sapratu, kad es to ierakstīju, bet es to atstāju. Man dzīvē dažreiz šķiet, ka jums vienkārši ir jāņem L.	22
jā tev taisnība. Es tikai paskatījos un nodomāju, ka tas ir svilpiens, haha	1,4
Man patīk, ka tu rūpējies, lai pēdējie 4 vai 5 neapgāztos. Tas ir svarīgi.	4,18
gribu* avotu par to, atvainojos.	24
Mamma to darīja visu laiku, kad es biju bērns.	27
Mums bija tik daudz pvp pirms šīs alianses izveidošanas, tās laikā un pēc tās.	27
Ja nopietni, tas mani tiešām iepriecināja! Es ceru, ka, kad OP ritināja cauri, viņa arī juta nelielu laimes tirpšanu.	17
Viņas melīgā, no narkotikām atkarīga, pedofīla vecmāmiņa ar fiziskām slimībām, kas viņai rada nopietnas nāvējošas briesmas vairākos līmeņos.	3,10
Tas pats. Es neatbalstīju Pats. ES biju sakņojies pret priekšniekiem. AFC West ir mūsu un tikai mūsu :)	8
Ak, [NAME], neatklāj TO stāstu!	3
[NAME]. Trešās paaudzes [RELIGION] striptīzdejotāja!! Pie velna jā es watcg 90DF!!!!	27
Nezināju, ka viņi spēlē uz mazāka laukuma kombainā, lai redzētu, kā viņiem veicas ar mazāku reakcijas laiku. Tas likās interesanti.	22
Tauki vienmēr ir neveselīgi un nekad nav skaistuma pazīme.	10
Tas izskatās pēc dārga hobija.	27
Šis nav r/lostredditors materiāls, ja mēs vienkārši mēģinām tajā atrast kaut ko muļķīgu.	10
Es vienmēr atkāpjos un vienmēr to nožēloju.	9,25
Digitālā labklājība	27
Es zināju, ka jums ir bērni, es nezināju, ka viņi ir pietiekami veci, lai pievienotos armijai, lol. Daudz laimes dzimšanas dienā tavam dēlam, tēti.	1,17
Ā, tāpēc saka, neskrien pa koridoru	27
acīmredzot, jo tu to nedarīsi	27
viņš ir nenobriedis	27
Vecas kokmateriālu dzirnavas. Vai tā bija ilgstoša aizsardzība un uzbrukums?	7
Okubo pateicas JP/EU par viņu darbu nedēļas nogalē pie ielāpu piezīmēm, un tad ES nepublicē savas ielāpu piezīmes :-/	15
Šī zvaigzne, kas uzvarēja kalderu	17
&gt; ja es vairs nedzīvotu ar kodolieročiem bruņotā/~~lielvarā~~ *daudz svarīgā, bet ne tuvu tik svarīgā kā viņi domā* varā FTFY	27
nevis lamatas	27
Mums nav nekādu variantu. Es domāju, ka [NAME] bija jāsāk.	27
Es ceru, ka jūsu meita saņems vajadzīgo palīdzību un kādreiz kļūs labāk.	8,20
Jā, ļoti neizpratnē par to, ņemot vērā, ka viņa bija tikai [NAME], kas ēda liellopu gaļu ar lol	1,6
Tā ir MLK diena, tāpēc mēs piedāvājam savus labākos Ford F250 piedāvājumus!	27
Vai negging kādreiz tiešām darbojas?	7
Pastāstiet [NAME], ka tas biju es...	27
ir arī r/priekšāda jo kāpēc gan ne	27
LOL, kā viņš nav uzjautrināts?! Viņiem nepatīk patiesība haha	1
36 un noteikti ne tas, kas biju agrāk... tomēr ok!!!	4
Ak, jā, no vulkānu padomes	4
Mākslas grādi ir bezjēdzīgi! Tagad atvainojiet, kamēr es eju skatīties Pixar filmu. /s	10
Oranžā tu esi tik mīļa.	0
Sasodīts, paldies par avotu!	15
Man ļoti žēl jūsu zaudējuma drauga. Es ceru, ka arī jūsu pusē viss būs kārtībā.	20,24
Piebilde! Ceru ar šo uzlabot savu Miku~ Paldies un lai Muskuļu Gars ir ar Jums!	15,20
Kas es lasu šo pareizi? Tagad viszemākās izmaksas ir 3,66 USD? un nevis 2,66 USD?	6
Cilvēk, mēs esam nevīžīgi	27
Es burtiski nedarīju, bet labi	9
Dzīvojot kopā ar viņu, viņš vienkārši varētu būt!	27
Sveiki, [NAME] nav *tas* kaitinošs	3,7
&gt;Es gribu braukt ar velosipēdu Es gribu braukt ar velosipēdu Ah jā, tiešām liek aizdomāties	8
Man patīk, ka tas ir rakstīts uz piezīmju grāmatiņas papīra.	18
Vai tas ir [NAME]?	27
Jūs palaidāt garām lielisku iespēju šeit 22meirl4meirl42meirl4meirl	27
Labi, bet kā būtu ar kādu, kurš netic, ka Wi-Fi signāli mūs nogalinās?	7
Mums vajadzēja viņu vienkārši paņemt un pateikt, lai ar to tiek galā, taču mums, iespējams, arī nebūtu [NAME], ja mēs to darītu	27
Izbaudiet :) Jūs to nenožēlosiet. Pirmās pāris sezonas būs nedaudz mulsinošas, bet wiki man ļoti palīdzēja saprast šo izrādi!	17,20
Jā, tas ir diezgan smieklīgi, cik vairums no viņiem nav spējīgi īsts satīrs un smalkums.	10
TAS NAV SMIEKLĪGI HOLLY.	3
Šis pavediens ir ielādēts. Nekad nebiju redzējis tik daudz monētu vienlaicīgi :) patīkami redzēt draudzīgu interneta mijiedarbību.	0
Man nav ne jausmas, lol. Saņemiet manu atbalstu.	1,6
Neļaujiet OP galvenajai hakeru fantāzijai	27
[NAME] jautrs	1
Es vienmēr esmu izmantojis vidēja izmēra skrūvgriezi, bet tas var sabojāt dakšas, tāpēc izmantojiet irbulīti, un jums vajadzētu būt labi	4
Tie tika noņemti, tāpēc es neesmu pārliecināts, vai es tomēr vēlos to redzēt.	10
Viņš upurē sevi mūsu grēku dēļ. [NAME] svētī.	5
Lika man aizdomāties par to BBC video par iepazīšanos Šetlendā.	27
Tas neizklausās pareizi, bet es nezinu pietiekami daudz par zvaigznēm, lai to apstrīdētu	3
Nu nevajag te sūdzēties par citu mediju lol	1
Skatieties no gaišās puses, iespējams, jums nekad vairs par to nebūs jāuztraucas.	20
Tas man lika rīstīties lol	27
Oho, tas ir labi zināt, tas vienmēr ir bijis mans garšīgais kečups, kad mājās gatavoju saldētus kartupeļus.	13
Biežumam, ar kādu es dzirdu &quot;aizbraucis uz ārzemēm, lai aizstāvētu mūsu valsti&quot; bez ironijas piegarša, jau pats par sevi vajadzētu būt noziedzīgam.	27
Es nesapratu, jo tas nav tumšais režīms	10
jā, lūdzu, tas padarītu lietas mazāku pārdomāšanu un stresu	4
Šī ir naida apakšgrupa	2
Es jutu tādu pašu vainu, kad pārstāju ticēt [NAME]	24
Tātad, piemēram, palīgs? Interesanti	7
Es esmu tik pagodināts	15
Sadalīti kāju matu gali ir tas, kā es nosaku, kad ir pienācis laiks novilkt ziemas mēteli	27
Tu šobrīd esi projām, iespējams, mans ceļojums tikai sākas, es paņēmu pusi no šīs summas.	1
Ļoti gudrs!	0
Vai Dr [NAME] var to apstiprināt? Edit: nav nozīmes. THICCDON patiesībā ir zaddy af.	27
Es TIKAI domāju par to, cik ļoti man patika Swalla la laaaa arī pagājušajā naktī!	17
Šis skaitlis man šķiet nedaudz zems	9
Es domāju, ka tas bija [NAME], un es pat neesmu pārliecināts, ka [NAME] to saprata. lol. Tad viņš tika izveidots par debīli.	1,3
Tuvošanās nedarbojas, ja vien jūs neesat [NAME] vai kas cits. Savā dzīvē esmu redzējis tikai 2 pieejas, un abas bija noraidījumi.	27
Lieliski. Tagad kāda meitene Jūtā to piesavinās savā izlaidumā šogad, jo viņa &quot;novērtē&quot; kultūru.	0
Tātad vēl [NAME]? Nē paldies. Mīlu puišus, bet tas ir blakus projektiem.	18
Pametu [RELIĢIJU] un plānoju BEIDZOT nodzīvot SAVU dzīvi pilnvērtīgi, bez baltiem vīriešiem baltā kreklā, kas man katru sekundi nestāsta, ko darīt!	27
Op, visticamāk, ir jauns un bezjēdzīgs. Iespējams, ka tie ir mazumtirdzniecībā.	4,27
Viņiem visiem šobrīd ir labi. Izvēlieties to, kas jūs interesē, un izbaudiet to.	17
Man reti kad patīk vai komentē YouTube. Bet es veidoju brīnišķīgus atskaņošanas sarakstus, tāpēc es to izmantoju vairāk kā rīku, nevis kopienu.	4
Manuprāt, arī nodomu ignorēšana ir smieklīga, taču es arī domāju, ka tikai skatīties uz nodomiem (un pēc nominālvērtības) ir nedaudz naivi.	27
Es tikai priecājos, ka saņemsim vai nu [NAME], vai [NAME]. Šķiet, ka viņi abi būs zvēri, un tas aizpildīs mūsu vislielāko vajadzību	17
Maz ticams, bet kas zina? Atmiņas ātrums spēlēs reti ietekmē, taču esmu redzējis dīvainākas lietas.	7
Man patīk viesmīles. Vai tie nav uzbriest.	4,7,18
Teksts nav lielisks līdzeklis sarkasmam.	27
ar dziļām kabatām tu domā Fleshlight?	6
Sasodīts, ja neviens nezina, kas viņi ir, nolādēts, ja zina	27
Tas ir delikāts, tāpēc tas ir skaidrs tiem, kam ir miesas tonis [NAME].	22
man tas patīk! Jauks sprite darbiņš....	18
Bija jau traks, kad nebija centrs. Tad, kad tas apgāzās, es biju nikns. Sasodītai mašīnai nav smadzeņu.	3
Es redzu paziņojumus par cilvēkiem, kuri komentē avotu, taču šai apakšgrupai ir jādzēš automātiski vai kaut kas cits. Atvainojiet, puiši. Es viņu apēdu un tomēr ātri atradu.	25
Ir labi iemesli, bet jūs, kartupeļi, vienkārši notīriet to ar vārdiem &quot;steidzieties, dzīve ir slikta, jo dažreiz notiek sliktas lietas&quot;	27
Jā, es neatveru nevienu PDF no uzņēmuma. Drīzāk iegūstiet manu ļaunprātīgo programmatūru vecmodīgā veidā... no pornogrāfijas.	27
Tas ir pārsteidzošs!!	0
Hei draugs, valkā vai tu ausi kā van-go.	27
👍 lieliski! Es domāju, vai kāds cits zina šo maz zināmo tīrradni no vēstures.	0
es domāju, ka man patīk sacensību izgarojumu smarža	18
Tas ir hotdogu vārds [NAME]	27
Cilvēki, kuri nevēlas piederēt mājām	27
Tu esi mans nakts mvp haha. Es šovakar iegriezīšos, paldies!	1,15
Veiksmi pārmaiņās.	15
Viņam bija daudz sarkano mirušo 2	27
Es zinu, ka tas ir kā šī hipsteriskā frāze, tas ir tik stulbi, it kā tu nebūtu no dienvidiem, tu stulbā mātīte.	2
Runa nav par naudu, bet gan par spēles mīlestību.	22
Tam ir kaut kāda jēga. Par ko te strīdas?	7,27
Tā, kur MIL applūdināja visu māju	27
Sasodīts [NAME]!	27
Tam īsti nav nekādas struktūras vai kompozīcijas. Krāsu shēma ir saspringta, bet tā ir vienkārši izmesta bez jebkāda virziena.	27
Paldies par atbildi! Es droši vien smēķēšu, kā jūs teicāt, reizi, varbūt divas reizes mēnesī. Vēlreiz paldies!	15
Dažreiz tās ir vienīgās iespējas. Smiekli liek citiem cilvēkiem justies labāk, vismaz tāpēc jums tas jādara.	5
Nav arī mans viedoklis, bet skaņu celiņš ir viena no labākajām spēles daļām. Tas ir neticami.	0
Teksts uz runu ir ļoti slikta ideja. Jūs nevēlaties dot 4000 cilvēku pilnīgu kontroli pār to, kas tiek skaļi pateikts straumē.	3
Daži no viņiem ir maldīgi un uzskata, ka viņu upuri to vēlas	3,27
Paldies, es to ienīstu.	15
Nosaukums lika man domāt, ka uz sekundi esmu r/boottoobig	27
ko, pie velna, tu mācies pirmajā klasē, kas tik un tā ir tik svarīgi?	2
&gt;Izklaidējieties, debatējot par cilvēkiem, šķiet, ka jums ir jautri.	17
Jūs man sakāt, ka jūs nesaņemat savu metogrāfiju no turienes?	27
[NAME] atklāja, kā [NAME] to nosauca atkalapvienošanās laikā. [NAME] atradās aizkulisēs, un no viņa ausīm plūda tvaiks 😂	27
Lieli čaļi. Biiiig yikes. Es jūtu tavas sāpes. Es vēlos, lai es varētu jūs balsot vairāk nekā vienu reizi.	8
Srs, ka toņu diapazons ir abysmal smh	27
Es esmu [NAME], kam trūkst pārsteiguma	26
Tas aizstāj sākuma pogu, un jūs to izmantojat, lai pārvilktu uz augšu un izietu no atvērtas lietotnes	27
Viņi teica, ka Teksasa! #Wooooo TEXAS	13
Paldies! 💓❤	15
Varu derēt, ka darbā ar to var viegli tikt galā.	4
Ņemot vērā jūsu lietotājvārdu un faktu, ka jums bija jāievada, ka NAV nepilngadīgs: tagad šķiet, ka esat	27
Pietiekami daudz pārtikas, lai pabarotu visu ciematu, vienkārši izšķiesti	9,27
Mēs esam bijuši diezgan labi pēdējos 5 gadus. Es domāju, ka [NAME] teiktais, ka [NAME] viņu nodeva, nav ideāls, bet varētu būt sliktāks.	4
Beigas bija tik trakas kā jauns bērns! Viņš pat nebija savā mašīnā!	0
Viņai jau iepriekš ir dauzīts dupsis.	27
Pierakstījies! Tas ir izcili!	0
Atstājiet, ka viņi tevi nav pelnījuši, un jums nevajag tos sūdu maisus	3,11
Nu, jūs uzrakstījāt šo lielo komentāru, un tas ir labi lasāms, bet, ja padomājat par to, ko esat teicis, IMO tas tiešām neko nenozīmē.	9,27
Sasodīts, es tiešām visu mūžu spēlēju šo seriālu... un es neko nenožēloju.	27
Mēģināju, bet beidzu izsaukājot pastnieku	27

Šī sieviete ļoti ātri tiek izstumta no šīs grupas.	27
Bijušais [NAME]? Mani jau nobiedēja [NAME], kuri bija bijušie d-line	7
Ir zināms, ka [NAME] veido īsu, sasodīti garu video. Ne daudzi vēlas, lai vēl vairāk cilvēku to darītu. Es palikšu pie [NAME].	3
&quot;Neēdiet cūkgaļu! Pat ar dakšiņu ne!&quot;	27
Neparastā rāpojošo ieleja.	14,27
Pareizi, tas nav tāpēc, ka viņi izskatās neglīti, bet gan viņu personība ir neglīta. Tas ir tas, kas visus dzen prom.	27
Palūdziet viņam kādu dzērienu.	27
Jā, es sadarbojos ar savu terapeitu, lai palīdzētu man savlaicīgi noteikt noteiktu uzvedību un pievērst uzmanību sarkanajiem karogiem.	4,20
Es vēlos pateikties jums par to, ka šodien mani nopietni izklaidējāt. Visu laiku labākais klips.	0,15
Mums kā sabiedrībai ir jākaunas par to, ka tas ir pat jautājums. Ļaujiet ciešanām acīmredzami beigties.	12
Kuru viņš spēlē?	7
Ja cilvēki nerīkojas tā, kā es vēlos, tas ir tāpēc, ka viņiem ir slikti iemesli. Lol	1,10
Šis raksts ir stulbs.	3
Es domāju, ka es ceru, ka Vilponi nomirs.	20
Tas ir nežēlīgi pateikt kādam, kam ir depresija.	11
Es domāju, viņa ir	27
Ķiploku sviestā cepta vista.....uzliek vistai ķiploku sviestu un cep.	27
Joprojām nav jēgas, kā [NAME] pārspēja bojāto [NAME], kamēr [NAME] un [NAME] nevarēja pārspēt viņa parasto versiju	27
Tas ir tik netīrs, es ceru, ka peperoni vienkārši noslīdēja lejā?	20
Es nekad neesmu redzējis tik dramatisku mēles iesaistīšanos.	27
Mēs, meitenes, esam mācīti vienmēr būt pieklājīgām. Pieskrūvējiet to, drošība ir svarīgāka.	22
Es vēlos, lai es dažkārt būtu jūtīgs pret savām skumjām, lol	1,8,25
Jo tos visus dara viens un tas pats, patiešām, ļoti vecs puisis	27
Es to saprotu, bet attēls joprojām ir smieklīgs	1,22
Vismaz viņa izrādīja reakciju...	27
Omg rotas ir labākās, vai ne&lt;3	0
Veiksmi procedūrā! Esiet stiprs un nemēģiniet nevienam pat domāt, ka var mēģināt mainīt jūsu domas. Tas ir jūsu lēmums.	4,20
Es tiešām ar to sakaros.	4
[NAME] neelpotu to pašu gaisu kā pret vaxxer, nenomelno viņu šādi.	27
Sievietes ir neirotiskākas.	27
Nu kā stādītāji to panāca? Soli pa solim.	7

Es atbildu, vienkārši sildieties ar kādu citu! Jā!!	4
Cilvēki man jautāja, vai es esmu cietumnieks, un es atbildēju nē, un, pamatojoties uz šo tērzēšanu, jūs arī varat redzēt, ka cietumnieks nav gudrs.	10
Tagad tieši tā dēļ es ierados šajā apakšā	27

Es gribēju teikt, ka tā ir ierasta prakse lielākajai daļai sieviešu veselības aprūpes apmeklējumu, lai palīdzētu tikt galā ar attiecību ļaunprātīgu izmantošanu.	27
Konservatīvie nekad netic nevienam vārdam, ko viņi saka. Viņi tikai tic, ka to dara.	4
Lol, uzliesmojums ir pagājis, bet es joprojām esmu spītīgs. Ar šo sarunu es pielikšu visas pūles, lai atgrieztos, tiklīdz būšu gatavs.	1

Es VĒLOS, LAI KĀDS MAN TO TEICAS	8
Jūs neņemat vērā pienācīgu procesu vai likumu, ja iesakāt [NAME] izvirzīt apsūdzību par pierādījumu iejaukšanos, jo nav nekā, kas pamato šo prasību.	27
Ironiskā kārtā katra /pol/ tikšanās ir daudzveidīgāka nekā cilvēki, kas veicina dažādību un rasu sajaukšanos. Dīvaini, kā tas darbojas, he	11
Vai pamanījāt, ka viņi noņēma manu ziņu? Jā.	7

Viņa smaids ir tik sasodīti rāpojošs	14
Jādomā, ka arī [NAME] bija noguris pēc visa smagā darba, ko viņi ieguldīja Visticamāk, jaunam spēlētājam būtu vieglāk palaist garām spēlētājus	27
Tas ir pārsteidzoši, kas var notikt, ja strādājat un vēlaties uzvarēt.	0
Vienkārši pavadiet dažus nākamos mēnešus, emocionāli atdaloties, tas padara šķiršanos mazāk novājinošu.	5,9,25

Burtiski viens šī subreddit apmeklējums ir pietiekams pierādījums tam, ka tas rada garīgu atkarību. Smadzenes alkst dopamīna, kad tās to neražo.	27

Turpiniet sazaroties, puiši.	27
Pastāvīgais spiediens noteikti nepalīdz. Es jau lietoju antidepresantus, bet man ir bail no PPD.	14
Manu tēvoci pirms dažām nedēļām skāra daži bērni, kuri izpildīja putnu kastes izaicinājumu. Tas ir smieklīgi.	3

Es tikko noskatījos 5. sezonu. Dievs, es biju aizmirsis, cik briesmīgs ir [NAME].	3,11
Kāds mans draugs ir tāds, un viņi šķita klusi satraukti, kad kāds no vidusskolas audzēkņiem atsveicinājās pēc tam, kad nebija runājis 13 gadus.	27
&gt; Nesaprotu, kāpēc saprātīgs cilvēks to uztvertu kā objektīvi zemisku. Vienkārši sakot, žurnālisti nav saprātīgi cilvēki.	27
Tā ir viena no deviņām BPD īpašībām. Droši vien lielākā daļa cilvēku šajā apakšgrupā ir cīnījušies ar zināmu atkarību.	27
Šie bija vieni no sliktākajiem komentētājiem, kurus esmu bijis spiests klausīties. Joki bija tik šausmīgi cienīgi.	11

Paldies, ka pievienojāt saiti. Es neesmu tik reddit gudrs	15
Adopcija ir iespēja. Jums nav jāpiespiež kāds pastāvēt, bet jūs varat ļaut viņam dzīvot labu dzīvi.	27
Neticami, ka [NAME] ēra tuvojas beigām... šķiet, ka vakar es redzēju viņa 1. uzvaru pret kovbojiem ar tiki, pārspējot skriešanās rekordu.	25,26
ES GRIBĒJU VISPĀRĒJĀM VEIKSMI, LAI DZĪVOTIES UZ JAUNANGLIJAS UN *TAD* 60 MINŪTES PĀRSTĀTU UN LAUKU LAUKU.	8
Vai jūs sakāt, ka visvairāk cieš miljardieri psihopāti? Mani mulsina formulējums.	6
Vai jūs zināt, pat tad, ja sievietes valkā savus matus dabiskus, viņas joprojām izmanto produktus pareizi?	27
Labākais draugs man iegādātos vibratoru. Ne tas, kas liks man justies kā eļļainam, neglītam sūdam.	4,5
Izskatās pēc laba drauga	0
Tomēr, manuprāt, viņš šosezon ir spēlējis labāk.	0
Prieks dzirdēt, ka jūs kopā esat tik mīļi! Novēlu jums visu to labāko. Droši rakstiet man PM jebkurā laikā!	0
Tās ir seksistiskas teorijas, nevis fakti.	27
Man šis likuma aspekts šķiet tik smieklīgs. Es domāju, ka piparu aerosols ir nāvējošs cilvēkiem ar elpošanas traucējumiem, piemēram, astmu vai dažām retām alerģijām.	3
DZIRDĒJU, KĀDS KĀDS SAKA F VĀRDU	27
Nevar neko daudz darīt, jo mūsu vienīgais šodien pieejamais bumbu apstrādātājs ir Napier	27
Es vienmēr esmu dīvaina, kad redzu viņu bez bārdas, jo manā spēlē man ir garākā bārda, kādu vien varēju	27
Jūs pavadāt laiku The Donald, vai nesaprotat ironiju?	3

Viņi tiešām nesaprot collas vērtību	27
[NAME] Man patika [NAME].	18
Man patīk, ka augstu standartu ievērošana šeit tiek izmantota kā apvainojums.	18
Jūs esat iedvesmas avots	0
Es priecājos, ka tas izsmidzināja tikai soda, kad viņa īkšķis iekļuva bundžā, un ne visur asinis.	23
[NAME] pastāvīgi ir nepastāvīgs. Tas ir tikai laika jautājums, līdz viņa atkal izturēsies rupji pret [NAME].	3
Es domāju, ka tie varētu būt! Paziņošu viņai - paldies :)	15
Paldies! Ar labunakti!	15
Nav pareizi lietot vārdu “viņi” pat tad, ja persona nepārprotami ir sieviete/vīrietis.	4
Prieks redzēt, ka jums tas izdevās, thx par atjauninājumu!	15,17
Man likās, ka viņi runā par kaķi.	27
izskatās nereāli, it kā tā būtu rotaļlieta vai kas cits.	26
Pievilcība un darbība ir divas atsevišķas lietas, un jūs to zināt. Neviens neizvēlas, kas viņu piesaista. Beidz.	2
Interesanta teorija.	13
Arī es esmu tur, jūs iedzīvojaties šajos ieradumos un kļūstat pašapmierināts, tas ir tāpat kā jūs vērojat savu dzīvi trešajā personā. Man tas ir.	5
Es domāju, ka mēs bijām labākā pretuzbrukumu komanda. Tas skaitītājs bija tik neapmierinošs	9
Ir Cubs fani, kuri nomira 95 gadu vecumā, nekad neredzot, ka viņu iecienītākā komanda izcīna titulu. Kurā brīdī LOILTY ir tā vērts?	9
Arī. Izlasiet sānjoslu, paldies.	15
viņš bija zvaigžņu Memfisas spēlē. godīgi sakot, aizmirsu par to	27
Viņš jau 40 gadus iet uz restorānu un aizmirsa, kā tas izskatās un kur tas atrodas.. uh huh.	27
PC Plod. Vecais rēķins	27
Skaidrs, ka ar politiku kaut kas patiešām nav kārtībā.	4
Nevaino mūs, jo tu esi stulbs.	2,3
Ak dievs, vai tu esi [NAME]? Ja esat, es esmu liels fans. Es pabeidzu IX EE šodien, izmantojot jūsu ceļvedi	13,26
Paliec stiprs vecīt	5
Tā visi saka, bet viņi ir neglīti. Es gribu Diavel, m109 vai Vrod.	10
IIRC ir Simpsonu sērija, kurā [NAME] ir ieprogrammējis tālruņa avārijas pogu, lai piezvanītu uz picu.	27
. . . Pagaidi mirkli	2,3
Es prātoju &quot;kāpēc nešķiet, ka viņi gūst progresu&quot;, pirms es sapratu, cik īsa bija cilpa...	22
[NAME] ir sajūsmā, es priecājos, ka viņš ir sajūsmā	13
&quot;[NAME] vai jūs joprojām esat šeit? Ak, tu tiešām esi lēns. ”	9
Man likās, ka pēdējā mirklī ēdīsi steiku ar kečupu,	22,27
Ak, es varētu derēt, ka tas radīja atkarību :-) 7x70 :-/	27
Vai jums garšoja	7
Lai laulība būtu veiksmīga, nepieciešami 2. Mīli viņu pietiekami, lai ļautu viņam aiziet.	27
Ja neskaita nelielu zādzību notiesāšanu no Floridas 2003. gadā, nav nekā. Citu pārliecību nav.	27
Man atgādina aplādes apraidi Welcome To Nightvale.	22
Jūs atnācāt šeit raudāt	3
Labākā froyo daļa ir iemācīties to izdarīt pašam. Robots ir bezjēdzīgs un slikti veic savu darbu.	0,10
Jūs, puiši, varat nobalsot par mani visu, ko vēlaties, taču šī apakšgrupa ar katru dienu izskatās arvien līdzīgāka r/gameofthrones	3,10
Bet vai man vajadzētu? Un kam es arī par to ziņotu? jo neviens no mums 3 neatrodas vienā valstī	27
Oho, es aizmirsu [NAME] un [NAME]. neesmu lasījis.. ir saite?	26
Tā ir metafora. Nevienam neinteresē, cik liela ir viņa anatomija.	27
Perfekti! Paldies	15
Ja [NAME] šodien uzvarēs [NAME], EV vajadzētu iemācīties nestartēt [NAME] RB pret pacy uzbrucējiem m	27
Es nevaru izturēt, ja tiek apšaubīti mani motīvi.	27
&gt;Vienīgais veids, kā pārmaiņas notiks, ir tad, kad nacionālie mediji faktiski pievērsīsies tām. Tieši uz ko protests ir vērsts.	4,27
Es uzskatu, ka tas varētu būt domāts cilvēkam, kas ir augstāks par mani, jo esmu pārcēlies uz monetizēto banānu valstību.	4,20
Pagatavo načo, paņem alu un gatavojies kliegt SUEY!!	13
Viens ieraksts, 155 updogs. Šo neapstrādāto spēku esmu redzējis tikai vienu reizi.	26
Cilvēkiem un uzzināt, kā viņi beidzas? Protams. Izņemot to, tas nav lieliski. Nomākta labākajā gadījumā.	2
[NAME] — es uzrakstīju nepareizi un tagad nevaru to izlabot	22
&gt;kaķim bēbam, tev nav taisnība	2
Albertam jāiet līdzi laikam.	27
Jums nevajadzētu būt tik bargam pret sevi. Vienkārši atpūtieties, dziļi elpojiet, ļaujiet asinīm plūst. Viss būs labi.	20
Es to teicu kaut kur citur.. bet es zvēru, ka vīrietis ar kapuci ir kaukāzietis... Bet patiesībā tas bija smieklīgi	1
Tu esi īsts MVP	27
Omg, *lūdzu*	3
Omg, kādu velni es tikko izlasīju? Man kā māksliniekam tas bija īpaši sāpīgi.	25,26
Šis videoklips tika augšupielādēts 2013. gada oktobrī, kas ir vairāk nekā pirms pieciem gadiem. Tas man liekas kā nevajadzīgi uzbudinošs posts par karmu.	9
Es saņēmu savējo tieši tajā pašā misijā!	27
Jauki! Es tik ilgi neesmu klausījies viņus vai Tool. Tagad noteikti atgriezīšos tajos.	0
Man nesaka, ka man ir problēmas ar puisis, kurš patiešām un patiesi interesējas par koprofāgiju.	3,11

Neapvainojos, un es piekrītu jūsu pēdējam apgalvojumam.	4
Tādas pašas drēbes un durvis no otras puses melnas - izskatās tik reāli!!	4
Es par to nešaubos, taču pastāv atšķirība starp kaut ko darīt kā sabiedrisku darbību un psihoaktīvu narkotiku lietošanu, kas patiesībā liek jums justies sabiedriskākam.	4
Man vienmēr ir šķitis dīvaini, cik populārs Nandos ir Lielbritānijā.	11,26
Mēs pastāstām arī savām draudzenēm, kad mūs aicina :)	27
Es varu attiekties. Tas kaut kā salauž tavu sirdi un garu, vai ne?	4,7
Manas 2 labākās meitenes sērijā apvienotas vienā un [NAME] ar [NAME] krāsām ir tik skaista :)	0
Jo vairāk es izskatos, jo sliktāk paliek	22

[NAME] boksa trenažieru zāle Rosā ir ļoti aicinoša ikvienam! Tas ir likumīgs boksa klubs, kas ir draudzīgs arī cilvēkiem, kuri tikai meklē treniņu.	0
Kas jūs tik ļoti interesēja par lielajiem baltajiem?	7
Slikto ir daudz vairāk nekā labo. Ne velti ir ievērības cienīgi pabērniem, kuri izturas pret saviem pabērniem kā pret savējiem.	27
&quot;Līdz šim viens no labākajiem&quot; Mmmm	4
Arī daļa no idejas ir tāda, ka tas nav nekas īpašs. Tas ir tikai mūsu karogs. Jums nav jāpasūta kaut kas atšķirīgs.	27
Tas ir pilnīgi labi	4
Prieks, ka neesmu vienīgais	17,23
Draugs, ātrums, ko policists skrēja, ir pārsteidzošs	0
Reāli tā ir viņa pēdējā iespēja saņemt lielu algas dienu.	27
Vērojot draudzenes kāzas, es nolēmu apprecēties rātsnamā. Es gribēju laulību, bet ne kāzas.	8
Mani tur satrauca	14
Bzzzzt, mēģiniet vēlreiz	27
Man burtiski nepieder neviens sarkans krekls. Vai pelēks, dzeltenbrūns vai purpursarkans būtu piemērots?	27
Tas ir patiešām lēts risinājums diezgan izplatītai šo spēļu kritikai.	3
Vai mēs visi kopā varam pieņemt, ka [NAME] šajā nedēļā ir ieguvis augstu vietu? Labi paldies	15
Tātad Amerika un PSRS jums ir viens un tas pats? Atvainojiet, ka esat tik mazprātīgs, ceru, ka nākotnē iemācīsities augt.	20,24
Tas pat nav jaunums.	10
Atteikšanās maksāt kādam par paveikto darbu ir zādzība. Jūs varat mēģināt to attaisnot, kā vēlaties, bet tā tas ir.	10,27
Es tikko noklausījos to šodien ceļā no skolas! [NAME] anatomija iepazīstināja ar skaistu mūziku.	0
Šis ir mans bijušais, un es visu laiku par to runāju	27
Lieliska izvēle! It īpaši, kad sapratu, ka viņai vakar bija jāzaudē...lai veicas!	0,20
Kamēr jūs nenoskūpstīsit viņas visu seju, jums viss būs kārtībā. Ja jūs abi to vēlaties, tam nevajadzētu būt neērti.	27
Hahahah tas ir lieliski.	13,17
Viltus ziņas! bet tiešām, tas ir lieliski, ja vecāki patiešām saprot, kā mācīt savam bērnam atbildību.	0
Mūzika mani pārsteidza	26
izturēju paldies visiem	15
I gotchu bro, house Autors Gucci Mane Es esmu milzīgs Gucci Mane fans.	4,13,17
Griezuma zīmju apraksts, ko KZ deva MaM, izklausās tā, it kā būtu izmantots zāģmateriāls.	27
Absolūti krāšņs rīts. Labāku laikapstākļu nav.	0
Es neredzu acu plāksteri	6
Es nesen uzzināju terminu &quot;kas pļauki&quot;, atsaucoties uz garšīgu ēdienu vai vienkārši patīkamu pieredzi.	27
Palīdziet man [NAME] Es bez iemesla esmu iebiedēts vidusskolā.	14
Rozā brilles laika gaitā kļūst sārtākas :) Galu galā jūs virzīsities tālāk. Vērojiet atmiņu, bet esiet klāt savās pašreizējās un turpmākajās attiecībās.	4
tas bija tik skumji :(	25
Man atgādina [NAME] IASIP	13
Godīgi. Es to uzskatīju par ļaunprātīgu ievērošanu, jo ievēroju burtu, ja noteikumus, bet apzināti neievēroju garu.	27
cilvēki ap to ir izveidojuši tādu stigmu, ka tas ir tas, kas vispirms nāk prātā, nevis pozitīvas domas.	27
Es domāju, ka šāda veida maskēšanās neizdevās šausmīgi, jo lielais kontrasts un definētās formas lika kuģiem patiešām izcelties.	14
Es teiktu, ka Rika un Mortija fani. Es esmu abu fans, bet man šķiet, ka Rika un Mortija fani visu uztver nopietnāk.	27
Godīgi sakot, retums ir labs, es to atrodu reizi 25 spēlēs, bet veselībai ir jāstrādā.	4
Šķiet, ka izslēdz starpnieku. Viņi jau zina, ka ir resni, tāpēc nav jādodas pie ārsta	27
Ak, vai. Svētī šo suni. Viņš ir liels zēns. ES viņu ļoti mīlu. Pasaki viņam, ka es viņu mīlu.	18
Es domāju, ka ir top 5, un viņi filmēja katru izslēgšanu? Tas, kas liek jums teikt, ka [NAME] nav (lai gan es vēlētos, lai [NAME] būtu)	7
Labākais, veidojot mēness spīdumu, ir ētera tvaiki, ko jūs varat savākt :)	27
ES atnācu.	27
Izskatās pēc tam, kad es pamostos vienā gultā ar savu onkuli	27
Un mākslīgais intelekts kaut kādā veidā maģiski būs graujošāks nekā rūpnieciskā revolūcija. Jo... iemesli.	27
Kaut kas ēd šo nabaga redditoru, un es nedomāju, ka tā ir sabiedrības netaisnība pieņemt sejas tetovējumus.	10
Vai esat kādreiz apsvēris iespēju pieklauvēt trīs reizes, un šī slēpņu/vajātāju noskaņa ir biedējoša. Tas ir pats satraucošākais, ko varu saistīt ar savu AR 15.	3
&gt; mēs nevaram tik lielu Jāņa bārdu	10
Es burtiski kliedzu.	25
Dīvaini, cik es zinu, esmu redzējis CoC atkritumu/otrreizējās pārstrādes pakalpojumu kravas automašīnas, kas savāc tvertnes jau pulksten 6:30.	11
[NAME] atkal saskrāpēja lmao. Līnijas tomēr ir labas. Diezgan optimāli, ņemot vērā to, kas mums ir. Man patīk [NAME] spēlēties ar [NAME]	1,18
Super [NAME] ar cepuri vai ar pulētu cepuri izklausās patiešām smieklīgi, ja arī neticami bezjēdzīgi.	1
Jā, labāk cerēt. Es tikko pārgāju uz Combat Pro no standarta, un man jāsaka, ka manas versijas ir 🗿	20
Kas tieši tur ir ārprātīgs	7
Analytics un instagram... tu joko?	6,27
Ak atkal būt jaunam pusaudzim	13
Šī ir pirmā reize pēdējo divu gadu laikā, kad esmu redzējis, ka kāds salīdzina pašreizējo politiku ar citiem seriāliem, nevis Hariju Poteru	27
Nē, jūs sniedzat vairāk nekā pietiekami daudz pierādījumu. Ziņu vēstures pastāv. Tagad bāc.	2
&gt; viņš, iespējams, nebija redzējis patiesību, kad viņš bija ievietojis video. Tā ir *visa sasodītā problēma.* Viltus sasodītās ziņas	2,3
Kāda velna universitāte ieplāno stundu pulksten 6:00?	2,3
OMG... tētis!	26
Es arī tieši tā domāju!!!!	13
Gudra izvēle. Tev bija kebabs.	4
[NAME] un [NAME]? Augsts piecinieks uz cheers tho	7
Klausieties tikai [RELIGION] mūziku.	27
Vispirms to redzēju r/teenagers, haha	1
Es domāju, ka daži cilvēki vienkārši ienīst jautrību, lol	10
Pat nevar pateikt, kas šeit notiek. Tas nav satricinājums.	6
Publicējiet noskūto [NAME] brāli! #1 aizsargs visur!	27
Lai mēs abi pabeidzam skolu. Būt finansiāli drošā vietā.	27
Es vienkārši esmu pārāk slinks, lai katru reizi, kad to redzu, saskaitītu subreddit uz 20 rakstzīmēm	27
Taisnība, taču, strādājot ar c diff, tas ir mānīgs, jo tas var viņiem radīt nepatiesu drošības sajūtu.	4,10
Jā, tieši to es teicu. Esmu pārāk vāja, lai to izdarītu.	4
Droši vien nē, un ar to man viss ir kārtībā. Ne tieši tāds amats, ne personas veids, kas nepieciešams atjaunošanas komandai.	6
Aizveries un dejo	27
Lmao serveri Amerikā nopelna apmēram 2 USD stundā bez dzeramnaudas.	1
Tas izklausās ļoti forši! ES tur būšu	0
Es kādu laiku biju [NAME] līdzjutējs, tāpēc tas mani nedaudz pamudināja uz viņa komandām	27
Varbūt, kad viņi beidzot tiks prom no Deivida būra, sižeti nebūs tik melodramatiski un uz degunu.	27
Vienkārši turpini un nezaudē cerību. Šādas lietas var notikt vienmēr ar ikvienu. Tā ir tikai slikta veiksme	9
Ak, es redzu, ko tu izdarīji... Mēģina mani sajaukt.	6
Jā. Es to darīju uni, saņēmu traku cieņu par to, ka turēju savu &quot;dzērienu&quot;.	21
Tu mani neredzi, Vern.	27
Tu esi idiots, un neviens netic tev un taviem telegrammas draņķīgajiem draugiem.	2,3,9
Tas ir labi. Paldies!	15
Ikvienam citam šķiet, ka [NAME] runā pārāk daudz un noslīcina likteni un izjauc. Mans vīrietis runā	3
Esiet kādu laiku vientuļš un labi pārdomājiet, pirms esat kopā ar kādu no viņiem vai kādu citu.	27
Tērzēšanas istaba vai ziņas??	27
Cilvēk, tu savus sims uztver ļoti nopietni.	3
Tev iet tik labi! Mēs visi esam tik lepni!	0,21
Ak, kādu samezglotu tīklu mēs aužam Kad vispirms praktizējamies maldināt!	22
Godīgi sakot, vienīgais, ko es ieteiktu, ir [NAME]	27
Kāda veida uzvedība tiek uzskatīta par nepievilcīgu? Es esmu diezgan bezjēdzīgs, kad runa ir par iepazīšanos.	6
Ja tā notiek, varat iesniegt sūdzību un saņemt zaudējumu atlīdzību. Viņiem ir pienākums jūs netraucēt divus gadus, ja to aizpildāt tiešsaistē.	27
Man šķita, ka mana [RELIĢIJAS] internātskola bija dīvaina, taču tagad tā šķiet diezgan pieradināta un maiga salīdzinājumā.	22
Mana biogrāfija ir diezgan smieklīga... Es saņēmu “Ja esat sams, tad no jums tiks iekasēta maksa par izsaukumu £120,49”	1
Sasodīts, [NAME] to nogalina	2
Mēmas, kas izveidotas pirms 2 vai vairāk gadiem, netiek ņemtas vērā. Droši vien viņi toreiz bija smieklīgi, tikai ne tagad.	1
Paldies, ka dalījāties ar mums	15
Ak. Man ir bažas par viņu un šo sarunu.	7
Turklāt [NAME] ir sasniedzis neoficiālas skriešanas stadiju, kurā &quot;retvīta fani spiež viņu skriet&quot;.	27
Cerot, ka LSU šeit var nogalināt 2 minūtes un 20 sekundes un neļaut UCF gūt vairāk punktu...	20
Vēl viena lieta, nemēģiniet, lai patiktu noklausīšanās vai kaut kas tāds, kas to vienkārši audzina organiski	27
Protams, tas palīdz jums racionalizēt jūsu pilnīgu nevēlēšanos rīkoties, lai padarītu pasauli labāku. Es ceru, ka jūs tiksiet tam pāri.	0
Es nesen dabūju darbu, kuru gribēju, tāpēc tagad man nav jādzīvo no algas līdz algai.	17,20
Paldies, [NAME] par uzvaru, lai mums nebūtu jāredz, ka [NAME] smieklīgā karjera sarūk.	0,15
Diemžēl nē... esmu Delavērā 😩. Bet es labprāt palīdzētu, kā vien varu. Informējiet mani.	18,25
Skaties! Viņam ir diabēts.	27
Svētais čalis. Visu laiku labākā ideja. Paldies.	15
Tas sejas apmatojums... puisis tikko pabeidza spēlēt Red Dead Redemption 2, iespējams	27
labā ziņa ir tā, ka viņa kritienu amortizēja [NAME] mīkstais matainais ķermenis	27
Diemžēl pastāv liela iespēja, ka jums joprojām ir nepieciešama automašīna, jo šī apkaime par pieņemamu cenu prasīs vienu stundu.	25
Es nekad nebūtu ticējis. To piedzīvojot, tā ir taisnība. Pilnīgi. Savādāk. Pasaule.	4
Dziļi sevī jūs zināt, ka sāpes ir pārejošas, un nākamajā nedēļas nogalē jūs to atkārtosit no jauna	27
Nekādas taisnības ar policista lodi galvā	27
Jūs muļķi! Tagad paskaties, ko esi atraisījis!	2
[NAME] būs jāizpērk, iegādājoties cepuri. LGP!	27
Guice bija sasodīts briesmonis.	2,3
Vienkārši paņemiet tos un vakcinējiet bez viņa ziņas. Nepieciešams tikai viens vecāks. Pat nesaki viņam pēc tam, kad tas ir izdarīts.	5,27
Jā, noteikti izvēlieties iespēju, kas nebūs sāpīga un kurai nav iespēju izdzīvot. Un padariet to ātri.	5
Tas ir patiešām noderīgi norādīt!!	23
nē, tas prasa daudz vairāk nekā vienu reizi, es domāju, ka jums viss būs kārtībā, ņemot vērā, ka apzināties risku	22
Es esmu Apvienotajā Karalistē. Tas notiek visur, un lielākā daļa cilvēku ir vai nu aizņemti ar naidu vai dzīvo burbulī, tāpēc ir aizmirsuši.	27
Es redzu tevi kopā ar Zangetsu, un man tas patīk	0,18
Jo fiziskais kontakts veicina saikni. Veselīgas attiecības uzlabo abu partneru labklājību. Rutīna var būt nomākta. It īpaši, ja vēlaties izmēģināt kaut ko jaunu.	27
Es domāju, ka tas ir normāli. Neanalizē kā tu izskaties un neuztraucies par to btw, tie idioti noteikti to nedara, kad saka savas muļķības	3
laipni lūdzam pilnīgi jaunā pasaulē, mans draugs	27
Ja ar zondi jūs domājat “uzdot jautājumus”, tad tas ir Lai pilnībā saprastu, ko mēģināt pateikt – kāpēc gan citādi?	27
Šķiet, ka pagalmā [NAME] un bandai ir jauns dalībnieks... [NAME]!	20,27
Burtiski NAV iemesla, kāpēc Japānas vērtējumi ir nepieciešami šajā ziņā. Nulle.	27
Arī Nerd un [NAME] atsauce uz lmao	1,27

Lmao, šis puisis ir instruments.	1
Izklausās pēc lieliska čaļa	0
[NAME] ir 110% 24/7/365 visu laiku Swag, es vienkārši nevaru aptvert.	27
Diemžēl veiksmīgi un bagāti cilvēki vaino arī ārzemniekus :(	9,25
Bērns domā, ka viņš ir [NAME]! Mmm... mārciņu kūka...	27
Kas notika viņa personīgajā dzīvē? Es zinu, ka viņam bija vairākas galvas traumas; vai ir kas vairāk par to?	7
Kad jūs apvainojat kādu, jūs, iespējams, vēlēsities sākt ar viņu apvainošanu, kur viņš var saprast, ko jūs mēģināt pateikt... kurš smīn.	2,3
[NAME] būs sašutis, ja viņš neēdīs burgeru, bet redzēs, kā [NAME] pilda seju.	27
Esmu pārsteigts, ka viņš izturēja priekšvēlēšanu.	26
Alkoina pavediens!? Šī ir pirmā reize, kad es to redzu 6 mēnešu laikā.	26,27
Vai mēs nevaram pateikt &quot;Komanda [NAME]&quot; vai &quot;Komanda [NAME]&quot; utt. Tas ir pārāk tuvs mūsu stila politikai, lai man patiktu...	7,10
Kognitīvā disonanse ar jums ir spēcīga.	27
Man šķiet žēl, ka jūs lietojat dzimuma neatbilstību kā apvainojumu.	9
Vienīgais nezinātājs šeit esi jūs un pāvests, kurš izvirza tādas pašas nepamatotas prasības kā jūs.	2,3
Tā ir problēma ar daudziem &quot;aktīvistiem&quot;, kuri domā, ka viņiem ir tikai jāpastāv.	27
Ak, es to sapratu mirkli pēc loga noripošanas, kad viņa roka iznāca cauri telpai.	22
[NAME] ir MOTHERFUCKER	2
Ak, mīļais, man ir [NAME] spējas	27
Šī atbilde ir ļoti negaidīta, taču loģiska. Es esmu fixin, lai košļāt par to burvestību.	26
hahah ja viņam būtu reddits	1
Neesmu Hot Space fans. Man patīk viena dziesma, un tā ir Under Pressure.	18
man tas patīk! Tas ir dīvaini burvīgi lol!!! It īpaši, kad viņa atgriežas pie kameras un runā normāli.	1,18
Labs alternatīvu saraksts būtu kaut kas lielisks, ko mēs varētu izveidot	0
Noteikti jāmeklē, jo pēdējā laikā es bieži saņemu šos zvanus.	27
Cilvēki ir pretīgi un vājprātīgi.	11
Ļoti izbaudu šo tbh	17

0,1% ir iespēja 1 pret tūkstoti, stulbi.	3
Vienkāršs cilvēks, kurš cenšas izkļūt galaktikā	27
Sasodīts, neveiksmju radītājs!! Kādam ir problēmas ar māmiņu. 👀	2
Kāds iemesls jums ir, ka neesat jau sagatavojies?	7
Esmu šokēts, ka viņiem nav tualetes šķīvja ar uzrakstu “Beer Cheez”	26
Man patīk, ka “jautāšana” ir pirmajā vietā un centrā to lietu sarakstā, kuras [NAME] karotāji uzskata par smadzeņu skalošanu.	18
Es saku, ka tas nenotika	27
[NAME] ir sajūsmā	2
Intp:(	27
Vienkārši ziņojiet par viņa komentāriem, lai modi parūpēsies par šo naidīgo šķipsnu	27
[NAME] ir bijusi šī problēma uz visiem laikiem. Cerams, ka viņa to izlabos, jo tas noveco un ir attiecību slepkava	20
Viņi ir Queens ģimene. [NAME] būtu viens no tiem čaļiem, kas sēž ārpus Bodegas un traucē vidusskolnieces, kad viņas iet garām.	27
Kāds drosmīgs cilvēks.	0
viņš acīmredzami nav gatavs strīdēties, es nevaru izlemt, vai viņš ir stulbs pusaudzis vai stulbs bumers.	3,6
Labu iemeslu dēļ nešaubītos, vienkārši nesapratu, kas tie ir.	27
Spogulis	27
Nekad neesmu dzirdējis par neko citu kā tikai smadzeņu sasalšanu. Vai siera galviņas virzās uz dienvidiem?	27
...Neviens nekad neatceras [NAME]. Ja jūs varētu redzēt šos citus, jūs noteikti varētu redzēt [NAME], kas ir otrs lielākais no partijas.	0
Tā ir diezgan liela summa, kas šeit ir jāmaksā nedēļā, tomēr nezinu par mums.	0
Ak, varbūt tavs brālēns kādam iedeva sava konta informāciju, lol.	1
Tieši manas domas, es ceru, ka [NAME] nesaņem pārāk daudz naida.	4,20
Veiksmi! Paziņojiet mums, kā tas notiek!	20
Jā, viņa ir pilnīgi izolēta. Daļa no ļaunprātīgas izmantošanas.	27
Un tad, ja jūs neizejat un patiesībā grēkojat, jūs neesat izdarījis neko sliktu.	27
Kāds garšīgi krāšņs rēciens. Man ir aizdomas, ka viņš nav viens ar saviem uzskatiem.	0,27
Izmēģiniet savu veiksmi ar ranked. ja jūs to izliksit pietiekami daudz, jūs iegūsit pietiekami augstu, lai spēlētu ar labiem spēlētājiem	20
Nē, es joprojām draudzējos ar cilvēku, kuru es augstu vērtēju, viņa draudzību viņš var vienkārši būt... tiesīgs?	4
[NAME] ir mīksts, kā ellē boi tika iebiedēts Minesotā	27
Interesanti, ko par šo visu domā [NAME] [NAME]	26

Esmu ievērojami uzlabojies, bet tas nekad īsti netiek izārstēts. Vienmēr ir situācijas, kas sagādās trauksmi.	19
In Rainbow ir arī super pārsteidzošs albums.	0
[NAME] apakšgrupas, delfīnu apakšgrupas un [NAME] apakšgrupas pašlaik aizvada lauka dienu lol tās pašas vecās lidmašīnas	27

Kā ar tekstiem starp viņiem? &quot;Ceļā uz mājām.&quot; &quot;Labi, uz drīzu tikšanos.&quot;	7
Es neesmu pārāk sajūsmā, ka atkal redzu [NAME] un [NAME] atkāpšanos no pārkāpuma. Skrien 3 reizes punt un spēlē lielisku aizsardzību. Zzzzzz.	13,27
Vai tā ir īsta lieta? Es esmu šausmīgs akmeņu mētātājs.	14
Droši vien arī ietaupa naudu. 3 papildu salvetes, kuras jūs neizmantojat katru reizi, reizinot ar tūkstošiem cilvēku dienā, tiek ātri pievienotas	27
Zināt, kāpēc jūs zaudējat balsojumu, es arī to izvēlos katru reizi un gandrīz vienmēr to paveicu sākotnējā sadursmē	27
Apsveicu! Cik garš bija ceļojums? Vai visu laiku pieturējāties pie [NAME]?	15
[NAME]? tādus nekad neesmu satikusi.	27
&gt;Pri*tualetes piederumi*	27
Vai [NAME] ir kārtībā?	27

Ak. Tātad jūs patiesībā esat pilns ar sūdiem. Labi, atzīmēja. Paldies.	15
Kāpēc kanēļa pulveris mizas vietā?	6
Kāpēc? Es domāju, ka neesmu redzējis kādu, kam nepatīk [NAME] irl vai šeit. Witten es tomēr redzu.	6
Jūs vienmēr varat izmēģināt pārāk sejas tonālo krēmu. Tagad tam ir 40 toņi, un tas ir mitrinošs.	27
resni cilvēki tik ļoti vēlas tikt apspiesti. Es domāju, ka tas ir tāpēc, ka viņiem ir nepieciešams attaisnojums, lai emocionāli ēst.	27
[NAME] un [NAME]. [NAME] aplāde ir lieliska.	0
Neviens nekad nav gulējis savā nāves gultā un neteicis: &quot;Es nožēloju, ka nestrādāju vēl vairāk.&quot;	24
Vai tas ir par [NAME]?	7
Arī tāpēc, ka daudzi atsakās no bērniem vai viņiem ir mazāk, ir mazāk nepieciešams iegādāties ļoti lielas mājas.	4,27
Paldies par sapratni	15
Arī BCH lielākoties ir pārtraucis to darīt. Neviens, kam ir nozīme, par to nekrita.	27
Smieklīgi ir tas, ka es šodien saņēmu savu. Varbūt šovakar tas beigsies?	1
Viņiem ir milzīgas problēmas ar bagātiem ķēmiem, kas smīdina bērnus, tas ir diezgan liberāli.	3
šeit ir jauks mazs ievada video priekš	27
tas ir šausmīgi🤣🤣	11
Pagājušajā mēnesī šīs apakšgrupas lietotāji ir iedarbinājušies, ja jūs [NAME] nenosaucāt par [NAME], tāpēc es domāju, ka mēs ar to tiksim galā.	4,27
Un mātes kreka!	27
Beidz būt pretīgs. Es nezinu, vai jūs to zināt, bet visi suņi ir kaili.	11
Vai jūs, puiši, nesen spēlējāt Vankūverā, vai [NAME] ir atradis kādu citu, kas nogriezīs viņam matus?	7
Arī diezgan fantastiski Good Girls Revolt	0
Labi, es mīlu [NAME], ka viņš [NAME] trīs reizes sasita dūri. Viņš bija tik neveikls ar to haha.	1
20 USD par daudz	10
Sasodīts. Es izsistu, ja es būtu tas otrs puisis.	3,11
Paldies par šo video. Tas bija tieši tas, kas man bija vajadzīgs	15
**AIZIET HAWKS!!!**	13,27
Godīgi sakot, tās ir labākās ziņas, ko esmu dzirdējis visas sezonas garumā.	17
Es nevaru iedomāties, ka Havaju salās būtu ļoti grūti atrast pumpurus	26
Cerams, ka viņš tiks tirgots	20
Es viņam jau pateicu, un, ierakstot numuru Facebook, atgriezos ar veselu kaudzi neko.	27
Atvainojiet?	27
Nedomāju, ka ar kādu no viņiem tiešām var kļūdīties, taču es ieteiktu viņu šogad noskatīties pret Dienvidkarolīnu.	20
bet jūs to nedzirdēsit no lielākās daļas preses vai cilvēku šajā sub. KĀDA IR VIŅU POLITIKA, LAI lmao	1
Draugs to sauc par ēnu darbu. Es domāju, ka tev ir taisnība. Tas prasa lielu drosmi un neatlaidību.	4
Jūs zināt, ka tas ir slikti, kad paķerat zobu pastu un sākat to lasīt	3
Kurš tas bija? Es nokļuvu šeit pēc tā dzēšanas, un es vēlētos izlasīt komentāru vēsturi.	7
Padomājot, es varētu būt skarbs pret [NAME], taču Bandai eksistence bija aizmirstama kā svings atskats Naruto.	22
Esmu pārsteigts, ka tas joprojām notiek, neskatoties uz draudiem par iebrukumu Manbijā.	26
Un tad visi aplaudēja	27
Man ir maz vai nav satraukuma, un tas man patiešām palīdz, kad man ir jākārto tests.	23
Paldies par PS	15
Šī krāpšana... kas tas būtu? Iespējams, esmu izdarījis izvēli, kuru šobrīd nožēloju.	7,24
Vai tā agrāk nebija Ziemeļu bankas ēka? Kabatzagļi Bangorā nekad neesmu satraukuši, bet, iespējams, tāpēc, ka izskatījos pārāk nabadzīgi!	7,12
Bumba nemelo.	27

Tas noteikti būtu pārsteigums, bet apsveicams.	20,26
Tas ir diezgan skaidrs, kāpēc viņi filmē dumjš	6
Kas par blēņu. Pasūtīju cirvja kastes karti	2
[NAME] ir viņa bijušais.	27
Tulkots: Wooooo baidieties no spokainās &quot;shadowban&quot;, tāpēc nedariet to, kas nodod jūsu vēstījumu plašākai auditorijai. Smh	14
Mamma man to atsūtīja, tāpēc es zināju, ka tas ir slikti, bet es nesapratu, ka tas jau ir šeit	22
Pārslēgt uz leju manuālajā režīmā, lai paātrinātu ātrāk	27
Man pietrūkst [NAME]	22,25
Paldies par padomu, es to ļoti novērtēju, un ceru, ka jums tagad klājas labāk!	0,15
Tam tētim noteikti arī ļoti jāmīl.	18
Mani interesē, kādas ir viņu rūpes un mērķis būt plus-size cilvēku ietekmētājiem saistībā ar to, ka viņi nepieder šai grupai?	27
Skatoties, kā [NAME] pagriež galvu atpakaļ katrā kontakta dūrienā, iespējams, ir visnelabvēlīgākā lieta, ko skatīties	3,27
Arī viņi saskaras ar nelietīgiem un sīkiem cilvēkiem, īpaši skolā	27
Labi. Es domāju, ka 18% no vārdiem komentārā, uz kuru atbildējāt, bija &quot;Times&quot;, bet labi	27
Ielu Samurai Koji un Ojiisan Koji ir mani personīgie favorīti. Greased Lightning Koji ir arī diezgan jautra.	18
ŠIS!!	13
Tā bija mana kļūda. Tajā ir jānorāda tikai jūsu vārds un mana uzvārda pirmais burts.	24
Man neviens nav nodarījis pāri	10
Šķiet, ka viņi to nekad nedomā, kad ierodas policija ar ieročiem, lai izbeigtu šausmīgo situāciju.	27
Godīgi sakot, ja jūs to nedarījāt, jūs videoklipu skatījāties nepareizi.	10
Tāpēc es mīlu politiku. Tas tiešām parāda, cik cilvēki ir stulbi.	18
Labs punkts, paldies par labojumu	15
Es to novērtēju, mans puisis! Es cenšos visu iespējamo, lai patiešām izpētītu savus uzskatus, tāpēc novērtēju aicinājumu.	0
Neesat pārliecināts, kas padara mani par gudru, bet labi?	27
Interesants lietotājvārds :).	0
^ bet viņa nav nodevēja	27
Mēģiniet domāt mazliet nopietnāk.	20
Nē, jo ēzeļi tik karsti nenāk trentā	27
Či snieg. Nevaru saņemt pārtraukumu.... Arī es to sasmalcinu.	3,9
Lielākā daļa cilvēku, kas nav imigranti, arī nestrādās lauksaimniecībā, lai iegūtu zemesriekstus	27
Vīriešu apkaunošana par mēģinājumu atrisināt problēmu paši patiesībā ir toksiskas sievišķības piemērs	27
Nomierinies sniegpārsliņa. Komentāru izsekošana pirms nedēļas ir ļoti skumja, it īpaši, ja jūs čīkstat par kaut ko tādu, par ko man ir 100% taisnība.	25
Tiešām žēl, ka cilvēki jūs negatīvi vērtē tikai tāpēc, ka viņi uztraucās par uzspridzināšanu tāpat kā mēs, nova bumbu lietotāji.	3
Negatīvs balsojums. Šīs čības ir jaukas.	27
Ak, pietiekami godīgi. Paldies par precizējumu	15
Grūti laiki nav ilgi, smagi cilvēki to dara... Die&#39;n ir viegli, dzīvot nav, izmantojiet to labāko	4
tas ir vēl briesmīgāk haha	1,14
Viņš var būt greizsirdīgs, ka tu spēji to izdarīt	27
Omg jā lol tas ir manas dzīves stāsts	1
[NAME] vienmēr ir netīrākais psihopāts	11
Meklēju šo komentāru, paldies! Ik pa laikam kāds satracināsies par paplašinātām zīlītēm un ievietos šeit attēlu	15
&quot;Es šeit strādāju un atceros, ka mūsu politika bija šāda!&quot; Vai es to naglu?	27
Oho, tas ir par traku. Vai esat kādreiz mēģinājis DMT?	0
Vai tā nav visu laiku sliktākā sajūta?	6,11
Tā izdevās! Veiksmi jums!! -[NAME]	4
Jūtos labi, kad blakus mūsu vārdam atkal ir skaitlis.	17
Nedomājiet par viņu, viņi ir nolēmuši, ka viss, kas kaut kā runā pret visu aparteīdu, ir vainojams pie visa nākamajos 150 gados, ir slikti.	27
3 zem 3?! Jūs esat īsts varonis.	0
Iirc viņa ir dzīva, bet alkoholiķe.	9

Vairāk nekā sauja jebkurā gadījumā ir par daudz. Jūs visas esat laba dāma. Pārliecība ir seksīga	0,4
Ļauns gars! Aizej no šīs vietas un nekad neatgriezies!!	27
[NAME] ir tik pretīgs čempions, pret kuru jāspēlē...	11
Daļa no manis vēlas teikt: &quot;Jā, tas notika.&quot;	27
Tas un viņš ir viltīgi netīrs	11
Gah skumjš piecinieks. Es mēģināju vienu reizi dažas nedēļas un vairs nemēģināšu. Man ir vajadzīgs šis atbalsts manā dzīvē.	8
Tu spēlēji torbu....... tāpēc. Tikai jokojot, tas tomēr ir ļoti dīvaini	10
Tātad demokrātija mirst šādi... Ar pērkoniem balsīm.	2
Jā, esmu pārliecināts, ka [NAME] lielākās bažas rada tas, ka Jaunā Japāna saņem kritiku vietnē Reddit.	4
Kāpēc tu turpini tos atgriezties? Kāpēc būtu jārūpējas par kalniem?	6
Jau pirmais teikums vien to visu apkopo 😂	4
Viņš tika iemests tur, lai mēs [NAME] būtu varonīgi izglābts no viņa puses un lai mēs ienīstu [NAME]	27
EDIT: nepareiza saite, atvainojiet, es ceru, ka šī ir pareizā	24
Es plānoju būt cieņpilns lol. Ceru, ka viņš tur ir.	20
pielīmējiet tās klēpjdatora kameras	27
Tā amiibo atkarība ir īsts vīrietis...	27
Es daru visu iespējamo, lai to piemērotu. Paldies, ka komentējat	15
Veiksmi visiem, kas izrunā [NAME] vārdu. Ja viņš turpinās šādi gūt vārtus, man būs jautri klausīties dažus NHL komentētājus.	15
Nē, es neesmu	10
Kāds puisis, ar kuru es devos uz HS pirms 7 gadiem, bet kopš tā laika neesmu viņu redzējis.	27
Lietotājvārds padara to vēl labāku, piesūcot puišu kāju pirkstus, kas ir [NAME]. Cilvēks, es esmu greizsirdīgs	2,3
Hmmmm, tas ir tik pazīstams, bet es nevaru īsti pielikt pirkstu uz	10
Es gribu, lai kāds mani aizved uz slimnīcu	8,19,25

Veiksmi Klīvlendā, Plaw Dog!	20
Jūs īpaši ticat, ka, ja nāves grēks netiek izsūdzēts, cilvēks ir nolādēts.	27
Tas ir lieliski!	0,13
Viņa ir precējusies, un es pārāk cienu viņas ģimeni un vīru.	5
Milzīgs biroja fans, un es piekrītu. [NAME] un [NAME] ir kaitinoši.	3
Jā, [NAME] pai	2
Man burtiski ir tāda pati kļūda	9
Piekrītu tavam puisim. Sekss dažkārt var uzlaboties ar laulības pārkāpēju partneri, jo viņš/viņa atkal jūtas iekārojams un seksīgs.	4
Kāds piedāvā mums [NAME] jaukās galvenās mēmes [NAME] versiju!!!	8
Iespējams, viņš vienkārši kļūst stresā, ka tagad kļūst tumšs un viņš dzīvo laukos	27
Tas ir apvainojums!! Uz fekālijām.	9
Vistas un olas strīds. Ieroču uzņēmumi neziedo [NAME], *jo* to platformā ir ieroču kontrole. Tas attiecas uz gadu desmitiem, atcerieties.	27
Man šobrīd ir tik stipri jāapglauda savs suns.	5,18
Reddit lietotāji gandrīz neko nezina par tiesību aktiem, taču viņiem patīk dusmoties par to, ko viņi zina	18
Es atzīstu, ka būšu diezgan laimīgs, ja mēs turpināsim investēt jaunos starptautiskos futbolātos un katru starpsezonu parakstīsim par 100+ milj. brīvo aģentu.	4,17
Jebkura repa dziesma, jo es to ienīstu	2
BĒRNIJS VAI BUST	27
Pirms darījuma es zināju, ka [NAME] ir [NAME], taču [NAME] skaistums mani vēl nebija sasniedzis	9
Tas ir šausmīgi. Kāda valsts? Ja jūs neiebilstat. Manu [NAME] vardarbīgi izmantoja viņas ļoti reliģiozais (vasarsvētku) tēvs.	14
Man šķita, ka viņi turējās rokās, kamēr viņi un [NAME] skatījās televizoru ([NAME] šajā sērijā izlikās slims)?	27
Es prātoju, kur ir citāts par &quot;atbalstu jūsu azz&quot;, un biju ļoti gandarīts, kad beidzot atradu vilciena vraku, kurā tas bija teikts.	26
Reaģējot uz [NAME] šajā brīdī, man kļūst sliktāk par mākslinieku.	3,11
Labi, paldies un paldies par LPT. Aukstā ēdiena pārpalikumi dažreiz ir lieliski, piemēram, auksta pica, aukstas kotletes utt.	15
Kas notiek ar visu gavilēšanu.	7
[NAME] x [NAME] kaut kādu iemeslu dēļ izklausās jauki.	0
Paldies, tagad katrs augstienes iedzīvotājs, ar kuru es saskāros, mēģina to darīt 100% gadījumu, un es vienkārši viņus iebaroju vieglā parijā.	15
Es pazīstu cilvēku, tomēr dažos veidos tas ir labs veids, kā izspēlēt mocekļu kompleksu.	4
&gt; sods par to, ka pateicāt izvarošanai nē Protams, ja jūs vēlētos kādu izvarot, jums tas būtu jāsoda par jā...	2
Dīvaini, es vēlreiz pārbaudīju, un tagad tas man darbojas. Tā nebija pirmā reize, kad mēģināju noklikšķināt.	27
Paldies par detalizēto atbildi. Ir pienācis laiks man uztraukties par to, lai padarītu sevi laimīgu, nevis viņus.	15
Agrāk mīlēja taju-taniku. Sen neesmu bijis.	18
republikāņi un viņu naids pret ziemeļvalstīm ir smieklīgi. &quot;Ak, nē, kaut kur ir daudz augstāks dzīves līmenis nekā mums, sagrausim to!&quot;	1
Tie nav [NAME]... tie ir [NAME], kuriem kaut kādu iemeslu dēļ patīk pozēt heksagrammas formā	4
Jā, es domāju, ka viņi būtu ļoti jauki ar melniem papēžiem un pieguļošu melnu crop topiņu.	0,4
Kas notiek ar telefonu?	27
Man patīk Shred 415	18
Tātad jūs man sakāt, ka [NAME] nav zīdaiņa sejas?	27
[NAME] saņem daudz negodīgas kritikas. Arī [NAME]	10
Pateicībā nosūtu jums Ramonas vīnu!	15
[NAME] atkāpjas no šīs sērijas, taču šķiet, ka viņš pievienosies cīņai, tiklīdz [NAME] kļūs pavisam traks.	20
Kas pie velna tas bija	2
Tu esi sasodīti atpalicis	2
Taisnības labad jāsaka, ka es arī turpināšu meklēt attēlus, kuros [NAME] ir šortos. Viņš tajās izskatās tik labi.	0,4
Seinfelds ir viens no vienīgajiem kultūras elementiem, par kuru es uzskatu, ka es varētu būt konkurētspējīgs nieku līgā.	27
Netīri putnu smadzenes mīlošie sārņi tik tikko ir pelnījuši lodes, kas vajadzīgas, lai tos izceltu no kalna. Moreiya 4 dzīve	2,3
Jā! Es to izdzēru (es biju vēls adoptētājs), un tad pēkšņi nekas!	4
[NAME] pagājušajā sezonā bija šausmīgs. Tā vietā parakstīsim [NAME].	27
Kā pazaudēts pirksts?	26
Bahahahahaha zivju vecāku dzīve!	1
Viņš nogalināja... JAUNIEŠUS	27
Zvēru, ka esmu to redzējis iepriekš? vai tas tika pārpublicēts?	6
Lol... es domāju, ka jūsu personīgā pieredze visu izskaidro... personīgi es esmu redzējis šo spēli vairākas reizes darba vietā..... tātad.....	1,22
Super neglaimojošs. [NAME] nav liekais svars, taču šis ansamblis lika viņai izskatīties kuplai.	10
Oho, tas ir patiešām lielisks skaidrojums. Ir jēga!	0
Jūsu menedžeris izklausās pēc idiota. Nav teikts, ka viņš/viņa ir. Tā vienkārši izklausās no šī.	2
Vai jums ir kāds tinder attēls vai bio padoms? Man nav selfiju vai spoguļattēlu, bet man joprojām neklājas īpaši labi	7
Oho, 3. sezona jau ir iznākusi. Vajag to pārbaudīt	26
Mani interesē atbildes, jo esmu līdzīgā situācijā, lai gan mana tehnoloģiju skola ir TDY	13
Jūs viegli esat tikpat klasiķis kā viņa.	27
Mana adoptētā meita man teica: &quot;Tu nevari man pateikt, ko darīt. Tu neesi mans tētis.&quot; Lai gan tas ir taisnība, tas joprojām iedūra.	9,25
Paldies par laipnību; tas viss ir pietiekami labi - es ceru, ka vēlāk šogad izvākšos	15
es to darīju, bet tas bija pulksten 3 naktī, pirms es devos gulēt, tāpēc es krāpšos un skaitīšu to kā 2018. gadu. LOL.	1
Es uzskatu, ka ļoti labi zināms Krievijas medijs izmanto [NAME] kā piemēru...	27
Man ļoti žēl, ka internets jūs ir sagādājis neērtības	24
Tev vajadzēja iet un pievienoties viņai iedzert... Tas ir mans sapnis... Galu galā apsēdies un izbaudi dzērienu ar maniem brāļiem un māsām.	8
kuram tf ir twitter gaismas režīmā	7,27
Es domāju, ka visi jau zina, kas jums patīk, tāpēc tas būs dīvaini	22
Es mīlu daudzus šī fragmenta fanātus, bet šis ir viens no maniem iecienītākajiem. :)	18
Tā ir sliktākā sajūta haha	1
Nē. Tas ir lēnāks un prasa vairāk aprēķinu, bet to var izdarīt. Tāpēc tas ir jāpraktizē.	10
Lūdzu, nelieciet vārdus manā mutē. Es nekad neesmu teicis, ka izvarošana nav problēma.	3
Kāpēc viņi tur apstāties ar 15 pēdu redzamību? Skaidrs, ka tā nav tikai kravas automašīnu vadītāju vaina	6,7
piekritu....šķiet, ka sižeta spēka dēļ viņa sāk buksēt	4
Par laimi, sevis atrašana un garīgās saiknes padziļināšana ar pasauli aizņem tikai aptuveni 4 dienas pludmales būdā ar salmu jumtu.	27
viņi slikti liek man justies citādi	27
Vai varat izveidot citu sīklietotni, lai mainītu viņa fona tapeti?	27
Es izdarīju un atklāju, ka būtībā tas pats, izņemot to, ka es ļoti viegli piedzēros.	4
Dīvaini tomēr. Tik daudziem cilvēkiem patīk sevi identificēt pēc korporatīvās lojalitātes.	27
Paldies, man tas patīk.	15,18
Labi, tā arī mana doma. Ja [NAME] patiešām saņem tikai 180 — ikviens, kurš nav noslēdzis šo darījumu (piemēram, mēs), ir diezgan muļķīgs.	3,9
Highgate Hill! Netālu no rietumiem, un tajā ir daudz jauku māju. :)	27
Šobrīd man jāsaka, ka [NAME] jaunais restorāns UB Preserve ir mana iecienītākā ēdināšanas vieta. Tik labi.	0
Haha, man ir 2 šinšillas no mānijas epizodes apmēram pirms 8 gadiem. Tās ir jaukas lietas.	1

Visu viņa seju klāj bārda un saulesbrilles lol	1
IESTĀDIET VIETĒJOS MEŽAS PUĶES!!!! Viņi atgriežas gadu no gada, un apputeksnētājiem tas patiks.	4
Pilnīgi tev piekrītu. Vienkārši sakot, ka [NAME] nav stulbs cilvēks. Gudrs cilvēks, kurš visu atlikušo mūžu pavadīs cietumā	4
Jūs nevarat ievietot Sons attēlu un pēc tam teikt &quot;I got this&quot;, tas vienkārši sāp.	10,25
Jā - paldies, ka šādi norādījāt - perfekti pateikts.	15
Apsveicu!!! Priecājos par jums.	17
Diezgan droši, ka likumdevējam ir jāmaina likumi	27
Ak, dārgais, man ļoti žēl, ka tu to piedzīvoji. Man nav nekādu gudru padomu, bet es ceru, ka jums viss uzlabosies.	20,24
Jā, tas diezgan atver acis. Man agrāk ir bijušas diezgan dīvainas attiecības ar savu atspulgu, bet par laimi tas ne vienmēr ir tā.	15
Nē, no Nebraskas, kāpēc? Lmao	1,7
Terorisms ir sistemātiska vardarbības izmantošana politiska mērķa sasniegšanai. [NAME] nav izmantojis vardarbību.	4
LĪDZ es uzzināju, ka cietumos nav narkotiku vai vardarbīgu incidentu.	27
Beidzot tas ir oficiāli, mums ir [NAME]	4
Ja zināt, ka tas ir pareizi, labāk ir &quot;pazaudēt&quot; šo cilvēku, nevis &quot;pazaudēt&quot; šo iespēju.	22,27
Paldies, ka ievietojāt šo OP. Daudzas reizes cilvēki maina savas domas un rīkojas pareizi, bet diemžēl mēs par to nedzirdam.	15,22
Tieši manas sajūtas. Pirmā doma, sarkastisks &quot;Paldies&quot;.	3,15
romantiskākā lieta, kas ar mani var notikt	17
Katru dienu visādi. Ja esmu apmierināts ar kaut ko nākamo, es zinu, ka es to aktīvi iznīcinu.	9
[NAME] 2011. gadā negriež potīti uz 🎾, un mēs uzvarējām premjerministra statusā.	27
Taisnība. Visu trīs jūsu ļaundaru apledošana filmas laikā ir slikta ideja. Viņiem ir jāveic kustības.	27
Vēl 2 trae piespēles, pls vēl 3 būtu apburoši	27
Tik prieks par tevi :)	17
BT Komentāru kabīnē: &quot;Kur ir tavs dievs [NAME]?&quot; Kā viņu sagrauj lauva	26,27
Tā ir sejas palma tikai nepareiza iemesla dēļ	9,27
Jo pastāv tāda lieta kā &quot;pārāk labi, lai būtu patiesība&quot;, un daži cilvēki joprojām ir skeptiski par to.	27
Likās, ka viņš gatavojas aizbēgt un iet darīt kādu metogrāfiju.	27
Nezinu, kā tas tika palaists garām. Tiešām traģiski. Ņemot vērā virsrakstu.	9,25
Es tikai uztraucos par viņa attieksmi un pieeju jaunākiem spēlētājiem. Rediģēt-pārformulēt	19
Tas ir patiešām labi formulēts. Es to saglabāju.	0
Paldies. ❤️ Es ļoti novērtēju jūsu komentāru	15
Esmu redzējis tik daudz no tiem, un man joprojām ir ļoti grūti noticēt, ka tas ir iespējams.	4
Kāpēc tik daudz zaļa, lai gan lol	1
Bezdarbnieki tagad ir par šīm nepatīkamajām veselības problēmām. Tātad tas droši vien palīdzēja.	5
Izklausās jautri no tā, ko es šeit lasu.	1
Vienkārši pagaidiet, līdz viņi redzēs, ko britu kapitālisti viņiem ir sagatavojuši, tagad mēs esam atguvuši &quot;arr suverenitāti&quot;.	27
Es turpinu tukšu. Bet es veicu arī vienu darbību. Tāpēc nepieļaujiet manas kļūdas.	27
Es to saprotu, bet izbaudu klusumu un vientulības sajūtu, kas manī ir.	4
Vai tas ir Amazon zīmols? Patiess jautājums, jo es pat nezināju, ka tādi pastāv	7
Viņam būtu jājautā mammai	27
Un jūs to sapratāt, federālais nodokļu samazinājums. Ja vēlaties maksāt mazāk nodokļus, jums jāpārtrauc demokrātu ievēlēšana.	27
Nē, es izvairījos kaut ko darīt, līdz tas faktiski nav novērsts, jo es nevēlos viņiem dot iemeslu vilcināties.	10
Es domāju, ka lielākā daļa cilvēku kaut kad ir klausījušies bohēmas rapsodiju, liels paldies	15
Mēs to nesabojājām!	27
Es neteiktu, ka vecums to apturētu, tikai mazinātu tā ietekmi, bet, iespējams, sāk to pamanīt aptuveni 30. gadu vidū.	22
Jums vajadzētu samulst. Ne tikai tāpēc, ka esat laulības pārkāpējs, bet arī tāpēc, ka nedomājat par savu dēlu.	12
Visticamāk. Ja viņš izkritīs uz mūsu 3. kārtas izvēli, es domāju, ka mums viņš noteikti ir jāpaņem.	4,27
Es nezinu, kāpēc, bet, skatoties šo, es esmu ļoti laimīgs!	17
Viņiem nepatīk būt no kaut kā izslēgtiem	10
Viens no maniem ļaunākajiem murgiem. Uhh.	14
Nevajag kaunu	10
Sasodīts, joprojām ceru...	20
Iestrēdzis uz ledus kāpnēm.	27
Mana sieva šķiras no manis, jo es pielīmēju [NAME] seju uz visām mūsu ģimenes fotogrāfijām. Viņš labi izskatās ar viņas ķermeni	25
Man tas būs jāiesniedz rakstiski, pirms es svinēšu.	8
Jūs to nedarījāt!	27
Ironiski, jo [NAME] vienmēr nodarbojas ar telpas uzkopšanu.	27
KAS NOTIEK	6,7
Tavs viedoklis? Tas nenozīmē, ka uz tā bija 2 no EVERY FREAKING LAND MAMMAL!	2,7
Mīlestības un spēka noskaņas sūtīšana &lt;3	17

Es tikko redzēju šo Netflix..... Tagad es to skatos... Tad tu publicē šo.... It kā mēs to gandrīz kopā noskatījāmies...	18
Nenovērtējiet viņu par zemu, viņš to var izdarīt 2	0
Es vēlos, lai es būtu [NAME]. Avots (dzēsts):	8
Viņam bija arī bipolāra depresija, kas bija galvenais viņa garīgo stāvokli...	27
Piekūnu fans šeit. Es jūs tik ļoti mīlu, puiši.	18
Lai gan es jums lielākoties piekrītu, man ir arī kaķi un mīkstās mēbeles.	4
Vai neviens nav domājis par milzu tehnoloģiju korporāciju, kas pārdod pārāk dārgus, zemākas kvalitātes produktus aitu klientiem? Tas ir dīvaini.	10,27
Labi tev! Es vēlos, lai es būtu skrējusi par savu dzīvību 18 gadu vecumā, bet smadzeņu skalošana ir reāla	8
Vai vēlaties dalīties savā domāšanas procesā?	7
Manam nabaga atstarpes taustiņam ir šausmīgs sitiens ar visām pauzēm Squidge vid	11
Neesmu pārliecināts, vai ļoti profesionāls tēla žurnālists vai dedzīgs porno entuziasts, taču labs darbs!	0,6
Tad viņš ir nevainīgs. Es labāk gribētu tādu prezidentu, par kuru mēs noteikti zinām, ka tas negrauj mūsu demokrātiju, sazvērestībā ar svešu nāciju.	27
Problēma ir sarežģīta, taču no 60. gadiem līdz šim mēs esam saskārušies ar lielu propagandu pret marihuānu, un tas iestrēga lielākajai daļai cilvēku.	27
Manuprāt, tas ir skaidrākais, kāds jebkad ir aprakstīts. Paldies par to. Tik un tā man izdevās....	15
Kāda frankenpape...	7
Katru reizi, kad es saņemu personāla nogalināšanu, ir tāda sajūta, it kā redzētu krītošu zvaigzni &lt;3 Jā, tas noteikti ir nepatīkami.	11
Šajā šovā viņš izskatījās tik stulbs, ka viņš bija [NAME] versija [NAME].	27
Es ienīstu šīs mēmes, jo [NAME] nekad neinteresējās, vai viņam ir vai nav deguna.	2
Un izskatās kā lieli zemes gabali.	27
Brīnums bija tieši tāds. Jo mēs visi zinām, ka nākamajā spēlē Vikingi cietīs neveiksmi.	26
Lielais fešs	27
Nav problēmu, priecājos palīdzēt.	17
Godīgi sakot, tev vajadzēja viņu apkarot	3,27
Es mīlu [NAME] un to, cik atklāti viņa atbalsta viņu kandidēt	18
Cik stundu apkopes viņiem tiešām ir jādara katru nakti? Man šķiet, ka viņi vienkārši vēlas samazināt izmaksas un pateikt mums, ka tas nav iespējams.	7,27
Iespējams, iespējams, nepavisam nav ticams.	27
Organizācijas pārmaiņu menedžerim un man tas ļoti patīk, un jau 7 gadus. Joprojām patīk iet uz darbu katru dienu.	17,18
Oho, viņš ir... neglīts.	3
ES mīlu Tevi kā mīlas dziesmu mazulīt. Un, ja jūs zināt šo dziesmu, tā tagad ir jūsu galvā.	18
Vispirms es koncentrētos uz to, lai būtu kareivji. Tas ir tas, ko jūs darīsit nākamos 4 gadus.	27
tas ir smieklīgi, jo viņi pat neko nedara pie skatu torņa, bet tikai skatās zvaigznes	1
Vai es kaut ko palaidu garām vai tas ir antijoks, kas šeit neietilpst?	7
Viņam vienmēr ir bijuši instrumenti, lai to izdarītu, tāpēc viņš reizēm var būt nomākts.	3
Labi, šis apgalvojums nav ļoti nepareizs.	10
[NAME]: Man žēl, ka tas notika. Es ceru, ka 30. gadu nebiji pilnīgi bez draudzīga!	20
Visi citi veidi izklausās nepareizi. SPR uz mūžu.	22
Tas bija karsti!	0,27
Vakcīnas turk err jerbs!	27

Dublina, Īrija	27
Varu palīdzēt, raksti man pm :)	27
Jūsu vārdam ir jāstrādā LOL	1
Huh... Esmu kreilis un nekad neesmu sapratis, ka to daru.	22
Nesatiec savus varoņus	27
100%. Lūdzu, ignorējiet viņu. Viņš ir kaitinošs un izdzīvo bez uzmanības	3
Pie velna, jā. Laimīgi, ka viņi kopā to izdarīja savai pilsētai. Šis ir lielisks stāsts par [NAME] veiksmīgo karjeru	0
Kā cilvēks no Luiziānas es vienmēr esmu pateicīgs Misisipi un Rietumvirdžīnijai par absolūto zemāko pozīciju.	15
ja manam sunim nepatīk u, tu nepatīk un ja mans suns iesaistās kautiņā, tu zini, ka es ielecu ar viņu	27
Sveiki, 28, es esmu tētis!	27
Tik daudz darāmā, tik daudz ko redzēt	27
Intelekts ir zināt atšķirību starp MB un Mbps. Gudrība ir par to nekautrēties.	22
Nepareizi, tas nav 365 dienas gadā. Reizi četros gados tas ir 366 dienas gadā.	27
#MELI. NEVIENS STACY NEVAR BŪT SPĒLĒTĀJS. #CELIES	27
Uzskatiet to par digitālo apskāvienu. Ne pārāk ilgi, ne pārāk īsi, tikai pietiekami, lai jūs justu cilvēcisku saikni un zināmu komfortu. :)	4
Paldies par dalīšanos. Jūs noteikti varētu ievietot dažas citas savas pasakas.	15
Tomēr arī balto homofobu mums netrūkst.	3
Kāds ir tavs augums un svars aiz ziņkāres?	7
Jāsaņem visi e-pasti! Rediģēt: stulba automātiskā labošana	27
10. noteikums ir skaidri norādīts, ka cilvēki, kas pārkāpj noteikumu garu, nepārkāpjot burtu, tiks sodīti tāpat.	4
Es, godīgi sakot, nesaprotu, kāpēc visi domā, ka viņam vajag pārstrādāt, jo viņam nav &quot;jautri spēlēt&quot; sliktākajā spēles režīmā.	6
Tiešām labs punkts šeit. Paldies.	0,15
Vai tas apakšējā trey ir piepildīts ar alu? Ja jā, kā viņš tos ieguva?	6
Protams, viņš melos, krāpsies un zags, lai padarītu sevi nozīmīgu sabiedrībai. Briesmīgs cilvēks.	14
Labāk ir vēlēties, lai viņi būtu fiziski veseli un izlīdzētos ar [NAME] vēlāk, nekā lai viņi nevarētu mūžīgi efektīvi sazināties, bet ar viņu jūtas ir labi.	5
Tu esi foršs	27
Nekādu problēmu. Ja izlasi, dari man zināmu savu viedokli!	27
Kādu iemeslu dēļ viņi viņam uzlika minūšu ierobežojumu, domājot, ka viņš nav īsti labā formā?	7
Es neticu, ka cilvēce ir spējīga vadīt *jebkuru* sistēmu lielākam labumam visiem. Neatkarīgi no iedzīvotāju skaita..	27
TIL Čedaras siera izcelsme nav ASV. Paldies!	15
Kā jau teicu iepriekš, es saprotu, ka vēl nesen viņus parasti nesauca par patvēruma meklētājiem. Tomēr tas nenozīmē, ka iepriekš viņi nebija patvēruma meklētāji	22
Paldies! Man bija standarta vārds, bet tad sapratu, ka nevēlos būt atrodams Reddit.	15
&quot;ES TEICU, [NAME]!&quot;	27
[NAME] ir mazs, izsalcis āksts.	2
Man nebija ne jausmas, ka tas mani skars tik smagi. Tas tiešām mainīja manu skatījumu.	22
Viņa labākā sezona bija veiksmes pilna. Viņš nebūtu nekas vairāk kā tas, ko jau piedāvā [NAME] un [NAME], bet ar sliktāku aizsardzību un sliktāku nūju.	27
Mē, tas vienkārši neļauj spēlētājiem ienirt muļķīgos postījumos. (Vismaz tā vajadzētu.)	4
Man patiktu ג׳וליאן, ja jums ir laiks! Labs darbs, turpiniet strādāt	0
Mēģinājums apkarot Senātu. Tam arī turpmāk vajadzētu būt izklaidējošam	1
Tas nemaz neapmierina. Ja tas nebūtu [NAME], tas nebūtu populārs. Interesants laiks, ņemot vērā arī [NAME] sabrukumu.	10
Šeit tā pati laiva, cilvēk.	4
Kāds mazulis...	0
Jā, es domāju, ka tas lielā mērā ir atkarīgs no tā, kā tu nokrīti. Džudo tā ir viena no galvenajām lietām, ko viņi praktizē.	27
Un tam ir jāturpina spiesties arvien stiprāk pa kreisi, lai nomazgātu visas muļķības, kas ir izlaistas kopš [NAME] stāšanās amatā.	27
Patiesībā SS bija melnādainie. Sava veida dīvaina analoģija.	27
Es nekad nesapratu nosacītā pirmstermiņa atbrīvošanas jēgu. Man šķiet dārgs veids, kā palielināt recidīvu.	6
Sabiedrība nekādā gadījumā nedrīkst maksāt par jūsu bērnu, ja jūs esat pilnīgi spējīgs.	3,10
Lol, viņš patiesībā cepa OG fanus, kas laiza viņa dupsi, nevis pats [NAME]. Pieņemiet pozitīvu balsojumu.	22
AA ir BS kopumā. Meritokrātija jeb GTFO.	27
Uz brīdi domāju, ka tas bija r/monkeyspaw. Vai nedomājat, ja es tomēr izpildu jūsu vēlmi?	27
Lieliski, svinēsim! Nosūtiet bezmaksas paku šeit ;)	0,17
Tas vairāk pasaka par to, ko [NAME] domā par faktiem, nevis to, kas ir patiesība par mūziku.	27
Un tas jums ir, kreisie, kas strīdas ar personīgiem uzbrukumiem un cnn modes vārdiem.	2
Viņa brūces nebija tik smagas, bet, iespējams, tika inficētas. Antibiotikas viņu salaboja. Labs kā jauns.	4,5
Jā, manas bažas, arī manas nevienam nepatika.	9
Šī apakšgrupa kļūst personiska dažu sekunžu laikā pēc visa, ko viņš saka, ka tiek publicēts	3,27
Es tūlīt nomiršu, ka man ir tik bail, ka visur ir asaras un puņķi	14
Taisnība. Es nezinu Senās Romas sieviešu izdzīvošanas rādītājus, bet es nevaru iedomāties, ka tas bija fantastiski.	6,10
Nav svarīgi, vai tie ir traki sakrauti. Mums noteikti nevajadzētu būt pēdējiem līgā.	27
BDS ir diskriminējoša fanātiska naida kustība. Tas nav tikai &quot;Ak, es nepiekrītu dažām lietām, ko Izraēla ir izdarījusi.&quot;	10
Forši. Veiksmi!	20
Jūs nevarat likumīgi nopelnīt miljardu dolāru. Jūsu darbinieki var, un piecdesmit tūkstoši cilvēku sviedru darbnīcās var, bet viens cilvēks nevar	27
Paskaties... viņi izliekas, ka tas nekad nav noticis. Lol.	1
Lol. Paldies par saiti.	15
Nav tik jauki kā [NAME].	10
Mīlestība ir karš	27
ES satiku viņu! Viņš absolvēja manu vidusskolu un atgriezās, kad es biju pirmkursnieks, lai runātu ar mums sporta jomā. Tiešām jauks puisis.	0
Faktiski to darīt ir nelikumīgi. Atļauts tikai tad, ja tas ir absolūti neizbēgams.	10
Idk, r/Tinder ir arī daudz ziņu, kas saistītas ar šausmīgiem vīriešiem	1
Pagaidiet, viens no plakātiem, kas atbild, izmanto kosmētiku pirms desmit gadiem.	27
Acīmredzot tāpēc, ka viņi izbauda savu toksisko ūdeņražoto atkritumu baseinu. Katrā ziņā es esmu beidzis mēģināt rūpēties.	17
Haha. Saņēmu tos. Arī tas tikai: Losandželosa ir dārga. Citās ziņās nemieri Tuvajos Austrumos.	27
Tu noteikti esi sajūsmā, es tiešām priecājos par tevi.	13,17
Fotoattēla ironija ir tāda, ka 60% no universitātēm iestājas sievietes	27
Meitene, ar kuru es gāju skolā, tika nogalināta šādi.	27
Godīgi sakot, izdrāž [NAME] pēc balvas vārtu sūdiem	2,3
Nevajag viņus vainot. Viņiem vajadzētu piespiest pārmaiņas, lai paveiktu to, kas jādara	5
“Es uzskatu, ka jo bezpalīdzīgāka būtne, jo lielākas tiesības tai ir uz cilvēka aizsardzību pret cilvēku nežēlību” - [NAME]	27
Jūs tikko noskatījāties reklāmu, kurā jums tas kliedzoši izskaidrots.	27
Saskaņā ar likumu Ķīnai ir jāpieņem Dienvidķīnas jūras nolēmums, punkts. Beidz mēģināt palīdzēt Ķīnai izkļūt no tā.	2,27
Tas ir kaut kas, kas jāmācās no pieredzes. Neesiet bargs pret sevi!	5
es zinu to sajūtu, puisis	27
&gt; Viņa seja, biedrs. Viņš domāja, ka viņš ir gājis. Pareizi pasmīnēja par to un izlasīja visus [NAME] akcentus	1
Nē, jo viņiem šis zēns ar invaliditāti ir bez sejas. Mūsu naidu un vitriolu ir vieglāk sagremot, par to nedomājot.	9
Sasodītā elle, viņi apgrūtina visus milžus	2,11
Dīvaina fleksija, bet ok	4,11
Noteikti viltots. Izskatās pēc slikta CGI filmā.	11
Vai vēl labāk, par sievieti, kura ļaus MAN spēlēties ar viņiem!	27
Jā, tas ir tas, kas mani aptur. Man būtu vadu visi mest manu automašīnu vai iedziļināties manas automašīnas elektrisko, kas nešķiet tā vērts.	27
Vai mēs visi varam pieteikties un iegādāties šo vietu Baltimoras nama vietā?	27
Netīrumu bārs pilsētas centrā ir diezgan salds.	0,27
Tādas 1. sezonas noskaņas, un man tas patīk.	18
Lol, kā jau teicu, ne viss ir par tevi	1
Viņš izskatās pēc modeles tbh. Ļoti izskatīgs vīrietis.	0
Man ļoti skumji.	25
Vai brīvdienas var vienkārši pārtraukt šaušanu? Es nevaru sagaidīt, kad viņš tiks tirgots.	7
Un jūs pieņemat, ka viņi ir daļa no dominējošās kultūras viņu ādas krāsas dēļ. Tas ir pašsaprotams rasisms.	27
&quot;Patveriet savu Glock, kad redzat [NAME], zvaniet policistiem, kad redzat [NAME]...&quot;	5,27
[NAME] sasodīti iznīcina Bamu, un man tas patīk	17
Tomēr, ņemot vērā [NAME] vērtējumu, rajonam vajadzētu būt zilam.	20
Tagad tu melo. Priekšpilsētas = vairāk nekā Bellevue un Kirkland.	27
Debates par to, vai tas ir trollis vai rupja pārņemšana. Es došos kopā ar trolli, jo jūs arī tikko izveidojāt jaunu kontu	27
Sasodīts, kurš nomira un iedeva jums Broncos	27
Hei, kāda sakritība tāda ir cilvēka galva!	26
PS. Es mīlu savu tanti! Viņa ir viens no iemesliem, kāpēc es iegāju &quot;medmāsās&quot;.	18
Tas ir apbrīnojami!!! Mēs vidēji 30 OTW, bet mūsu pusstundu darījumu skaits maksimuma laikā parasti ir 40–55. Maza apjoma veikals.	27
Viņi nekad to nedarīs, kamēr tas viņus tieši neietekmēs, un tad mums tas jau ir spēles beigu beigās :/	10
Patiešām. Man likās, ka esam vienkārši izlutināti, bet acīmredzot parādības mums nav ekskluzīvas.	27
Ak mans Dievs. Šai sievietei, kura nomira, bija arī dēls, kurš nomira. Svētā traģēdija	16,25,26
Un cilvēki joprojām viņu atbalsta....	27
Es domāju, ka tas ir tikai dabiski, cilvēkiem patiesībā nebija paredzēts lidot pēc dabas, tāpēc es domāju, ka tas vienkārši šķiet nepareizi vai kaut kas cits, idk	10
Tas nav īsti niecīgi, tas patiesībā ir brutāli. *rediģēt*, bet labi darīts. man tas patīk!	0,18
Tas šļakstījās pa visu manu virtuvi un medmāsu. Kurš tad teica, ak, salauza artēriju.	27
&gt; pats laikam esi mazliet skapīts nacists. Esmu ŠOKĒ, ka kāds vārdā [NAME] varētu būt fašists	26
Es nicinu [NAME] un visus viņa draugus	2
Ja gribat izvēdināties, ar prieku klausos.	17,20
izskatās, ka šodien guvām dubultuzvaru!!	13
Nedariet tālsatiksmes lietas, tas nav tā vērts un laika izšķiešana	5
Jā, es neapgalvoju, ka nav atpūtas potenciāla, lai gan tas noteikti var jūs sajaukt. Nepalīdz lielākajai daļai produktu ar dxm ir citas aktīvās sastāvdaļas.	10
Te tāpat. Man bija liels pietūkums, bet ne neparastas sāpes.	4
Cik apgaismojoši.	0
P o RZI n ĢIS	27
Bet kā tas ir facepalm? Rediģēt rokas nav tik traki.	7
Tas pats, ASMR ir murgains. Mana āda rāpo, tikai par to domājot.	14,19
Ak, cik slikta un novecojusi mēma	9
Izskatās forši [NAME]	1
&gt;klusais vairākums Šī ir visnezinošākā lieta, ko šodien esmu lasījis	9,10
Tātad, kur visi šie [NAME] ierindojas, lai kļūtu par ainavu veidotājiem un lauksaimniekiem par minimālo algu?	27
Zināt, kāpēc jūs esat negatīvi nobalsojis, man tas likās smieklīgi	1
ahh, brāl, es aizraujos ar [NAME], vai tas padara mani par nākamo slepkavu vai spīdzināšanas entuziastu gaidīšanas laikā? pat nezināja!	27
Es domāju, ka viņa Slikta elpa viņu izslēdza	27
Man patīk šis ieraksts. Vai jūs ar parku pakalpojumiem?	18
Es uz viņu skatos kā uz izpildītāju, bet viņš joprojām ir cilvēks.	27
Vai [NAME] vai [NAME] izskatās laimīgāki, ka [NAME] izvēlējās uzlikt roku uz [NAME] kājas?	6
Es novēlu, lai vairāk cilvēkiem patiktu šis sporta veids.. kad māls uzsprāgst, rodas tāda SAJŪTA	8
Tas man liek dabūt krūšu pīrsingu, bet man ir pārāk bail, lai to darītu :/	14
Man patīk gif, bet man ļoti riebjas šāda veida paraksti. Tas ir tikpat kaitinoši un niecīgi kā pilngadīgam pieaugušajam, kas runā ar mazuļiem.	2,3
Tas nav tas, par ko šeit tiek apstrīdēts. Stāstot savam bērnam kaut ko līdzīgu, jūs noteikti kļūtu par kuci.	3
Katram gadījumam pagaidiet visādas lietas. Ēdiet lētu pārtiku.	5
Viņu sirdsdarbība un sats ir lieliski. Nezini, par ko tu uztraucies.	0
Prieks, ka esi šeit :)	15,17
Viņš pat nav HC, viņš ir pagaidu... atslābinies priekšnieks	27
Labi laiki, labi laikissss lol	1
ITT: Hipsteri. &quot;Man šī grupa patika, pirms tā kļuva populāra un sūda.&quot;	3,18
Labi, ēnaini karogi plīvo tik spēcīgi, ka es tiku izsists no krēsla.	27
Paldies!!	15
Oho. Tas bija dziļi. Es ceru, ka jums izdosies virzīties tālāk un atrast patiesu mīlestību. Esi stiprs	20,26
Neatkarīgi no tā, kādu secinājumu viņi nonāks tagad vai nākotnē, vienīgā nemainīgā situācija būs tāda, ka &quot;nekas nav jādara, lai to apturētu&quot;.	27
Jā, bet es domāju, ka jums patiešām ir jābūt motivētam klimatam, nevis tikai jāvēlas izlaist skolu	4,5
80% valsts tic vīrietim, kurš pat personīgi neapzinās, kur viņš atrodas.	3,9,10
nu mēs visi zinām, kas ir sarežģītas maltītes sviestmaizes! hahaha	1
Es nemīlu cietumu — es mīlu lietas, kas mani aizved UZ cietumu. Iekāp, [NAME].	18
Es paredzu panākumus jūsu turpmākajos centienos.	8
Jā! Apsveicu!	15
Es atvainojos :(. Lol. Man pēc 3 beigām un Andromeda man ir nulle interese par MANI.	24
Ak, žēl, paldies par dalīšanos.	9,15
Izņemot visus tos uzņēmumus, kas iekļauti kategorijā &quot;un daudzi citi&quot;. Viņiem tas nebija tik ienesīgs.	27
Es arī gribēju to norādīt! Es mīlu JJGO!!	8,18
Es mīztos tieši uz viņu grīdas. Bāc šito.	2
Tas būtu r/smieklīgi ne šeit, ļoti gaidīts	1
Es to izlasīju kā &quot;tik ilgi piesūcekņi&quot;. Tā tie vārdi pārtulkojās manā prātā..	27
WERE* protestē Tas nav aktuāls. Maldinošs.	10
Wer was u wen sec is kill	7
Viņa, iespējams, nav tā, ka jūs esat iecienījusi	10
Ko nozīmē atvieglot? Lai mana darba dzīve būtu mazāka?	3,7
Nav īsti raustīties. Vienkārši skumji.	25
Es mīlu [NAME], nevaru sagaidīt viņa pilno loka versiju	18
Ej uz savu istabu.	27
Tava draudzene pieņem dāvanas apmaiņā pret seksu? Man tev ir ziņas, mīļotā...	7
Pagaidi... tas nenotiek	10
Ej mierīgi pret savu mammu; šī vēstule izklausās tā, it kā tā būtu rakstīta no dziļas mīlestības vietas.	4,5
Eh. Es domāju, ka darbojas vai nu. Bet noteikti. Atbildes, iespējams, ir precīzākas	4
Kurš griež sīpolus?!	7
Cenšos turēt rokas aizņemtas. Es darītu labāk, ja man ir akrila nagi, jo tas nebija tik vienkārši/vienkārši nebija tas pats.	27
Laiks dziedē visas rētas :). Iegādājieties šim vīrietim gredzenu!	27
vislabāk ir pievienot **/s** ......gandrīz izklausās, ka runājat nopietni!	27
[NAME] un [NAME] bija mani divi. [NAME] :)	27
Tas vismaz nav pārāk briesmīgi? Patiesībā tas nemaz nav slikti. Joprojām ĻOTI maldīgi!! Labs ieraksts	0
Lielisks citāts.	0
Jums nevajadzētu redzēt daudz gaismas surogātpasta iekarotāju, jo gaismas surogātpasta sūtīšana kā iekarotājs ir tikai ubagošana pēc atlīdzības.	27
Vienīgais, kas viņai nav kārtībā, ir viņas seja. Varbūt viņai ir dāvinoša personība?	9
Oho! Apsveicam ar seksuālās dzīves atgūšanu! Prieks pamosties un redzēt tādu pozitīvismu.	4,13,26
Es vienmēr esmu domājis, cik daudz no šīm lietām nenonāk internetā	26
Jums pietrūks ubagojoša veca vīra, kurš lūdz rezerves monētu. RIP	16,25
Oho, jūs nevarat atrisināt lietas. Eskalācija ir pēdējā iespēja.	10
Laimīgu mikrofona dienu!	17
Uz virsmas, jā. Dziļi, iespējams, nē.	27
Lol, ieknieba narizones.. Viņu fiziskā spēle ir citā līmenī. Labāk spēlētu ar tādu puisi, nevis pret viņu, lai gan tas ir skaidrs.	0,1
Prieks, ka esat laimīgs, un prieks redzēt, ka kāds izceļ labās puses! Vai vēlaties iegūt kādu konkrētu straumēšanas pakalpojumu? :D	17
Jūs esat pārsteidzošs cilvēks	0
Neticami, ka [NAME] tik ilgi ir bijis līgā...	26
[NAME] nevēlas pamest Sentluisu, viņa ģimene ir tur un nepārvietosies.	27
Es dzirdēju, ka viņas dēka izpostīja viņa laulību. Viņa sieva, ja par to kaut ko izteiks, sagrautu [NAME].	27
Pastāstiet savam vīram. Tā meli ar izlaidumiem. Kas tu esi, lai izvēlētos to, ko VIŅŠ vēlas uzzināt.	2
Prieks redzēt, ka esat atveseļojies	5
Jo tie tiek iedarbināti. Es tikai izsaku savu viedokli. Tas ir mazliet jautri.	1
Tā ir problēma, uz kuru es norādu, mediji izmanto stulbus klikšķu nosaukumus, un cilvēki kļūst arvien dumjāki.	2
Man šķiet, ka šoferim bija sirdstrieka. Viņa viņam pat nepamāja un nepateica paldies par to, ka nesasita savu dārgo bērnu.	9,15
Viens no labākajiem krogiem Londonā. Pat lielāka iespēja iekšā!!	0
&quot;Jūs esat mans labākais draugs visā pasaulē, [NAME] kungs.&quot; *ņau pēc ēdiena*	18
Jūs zināt, ko darīt. Sāciet stāstīt cilvēkiem.	5,22
Ceru, ka tagad viss ir labi xo	5
Uh, man žēl, cilvēk! Raustieties, līdz sirds ir apmierināta, un neatvainojiet par to!	24
VIŅAS BALSS IR TIK LABA, nav brīnums, ka viņai patīk telefona zvani	0
Bet tas saplacina visu.	27
Nāvīgi bail, arī laivu apakšas. Es nevaru skatīties, vai redzu tos bildē vai filmā	14
Ja visi citi to var izdomāt, tad es nesaprotu, kāpēc tas ir tik neticami ASV.	6,10
Vai civilprasība rada juridisku prioritāti? Rediģēt: Es pieņemu, ka tā ir civilprasība.	7,27
Arī Strike jebkur. Šis pavediens priecē manu sirdi. &lt;3	17
Man tā nav gadījies mobilajā ierīcē, bet tas ir tāpēc, ka izmantoju Apollo. Tas notiek darbvirsmā	27
Konservatīvais tiek masveidā brigādēts uz stundu. Diemžēl tas prasa stingru mērenību, pretējā gadījumā tas ir nelasāms.	9
Man patīk [NAME]. Viņš tikai turpinās kļūt labāks.	18
Omg, tavs segvārds mani lika man lol!!	1
Tas nav precīzs, pamatojoties uz šodienas sarunu ar [NAME] kungu.	10
Ah, izskatās jautri	1
Mans viedoklis bija tāds, ka viņiem nebija citas izvēles, kā vien izmantot sociālās sviras, lai mēģinātu uzlabot veselību, jo nekas cits viņu rīcībā nebija.	27
Es satriektu	2
Kā mēs varam jums nosūtīt naudu?	6
Izbaudi tukšumu	27
[NAME] joprojām ir dusmīgs uz [NAME] jebkurā gadījumā.	27
Tas viss pavediens man rada vēlmi kratīt mazuļus.	8
Mani kā Gredzenaraitu tas aizvaino. Lūdzu, uzceliet man sniega fortu.	27
es tam piekristu. Es joprojām neredzu labu iemeslu, lai nenodrošinātu dienas aprūpi.	4,10
Prieks, ka nāci pie prāta. Atkal jūtieties neērti par Lolas zaķi programmā Space Jam.	17
Jā, Kalifornija, es būtu pārsteigts, ja viņi viņu atbrīvotu.	4
Vai tu pat izlasīji ziņu? Burtiski pirmajā rindā teikts, ka viņa nedara neko attālināti kā sieva.	7
Psst, jūsu spoilera atzīme ir nolauzta. Neatstājiet atstarpes starp ! un jūsu teksts.	3,10
tik patiesi lmao	1,4
LSD vai sēnīšu veids? Ziņkārības pēc	7
Tas nešķiet pārāk atbildīgs atklājumu izklāsts.	10,27
Protams, tas ir labs veids. Diemžēl es pats par sevi neesmu spēlētājs.	4
dievs sasodīts, tas ir kaut kāds virslīgas patoss	27
Pastāstiet viņam, ka viņa evaņģēlijiem trūkst integritātes to anonimitātes dēļ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭	27
Nē, nemaz neesmu [NAME] fans.	10
Es zinu, ka pret viņiem izturas ļoti labi, bet daži no viņiem mirst.	3
Pa kreisi vai pa labi, vienalga, tikai pasmejies par statistiem visās malās	1
Man patīk, kā viņa bruņas kļuva arvien lielākas, jo viņš kļuva arvien resnāks.	18
Šīs mēmes ir vai nu 9gag līmenī, vai r/smieklīgā komēdijas līmenī. Un es nevaru pateikt, kas ir sliktāks.	6,11,27
atkal runā par mani?	27
Jā! Vai jums nepatīk ļaut mazuļiem jūs zīdīt ar perfektu žokļa līniju!	3,7
[NAME] teica, ka tas tika ierakstīts pirmdien pēc [NAME], tāpēc viņa balss ir tāda.	27
Tas neizskatās forši	10
Atvainojiet, jauns plkst	24
Jūtieties brīvi aiziet.	4
Atvainojiet par slikto analoģiju, jūsējā ir daudz labāka	24
Bise! Bet vai es varu spēlēt arī ar visām pogām?	27
Es atvainojos, tas patiesi bija domāts Askreddit. Ja paskatās uz manu vēsturi, jūs redzēsit, ka tur es vienmēr publicēju ziņas. Mana kļūda.	24
Nu 216 tagad ir iznācis, un es raudu. [NAME] kāpēc?	25
Svētī ux	27
Es priecātos par jauku siltu apskāvienu. Kopā ar apburošu sarunu. Bet tas arī darbojas.	8
Ak, man patīk somu dizains	18
Esmu nogurusi, bet nevaru aizmigt.	27
Vai NY un NJ nav savstarpīguma? Kāpēc viņam vispār bija jāņem NY bārs?	6,7
Viņi ir tik veci un tik paredzami, ka, ievietojot šādus rakstus, NEVAR redzēt, cik “dumji” viņi izskatās......	9
Tad es atvainojos, bet šī spēle tiešām nav priekš jums. Tāda attīstība sagrautu šīs spēles pamatu.	10
[NAME] nav pietiekami labs, lai sadusmotos.	2,10
Vienkārši atstājiet šo skolu, dodieties uz jaunu	27
Tas ir ļoti garš veids, kā pateikt &quot;es esmu debīls&quot;	27

Šķiet, ka tev ir sāļās asaras	27
Es nekad neesmu redzējis, ka [NAME] tētis izskatās tik atslābināts. :D	27
JŪSU impulss jums nepalīdz, tas ir virziens, uz kuru jūs mērķējat, un VIŅU impulss, kas palīdz. viņi droši vien atbalstīja, kad tas notika.	10
Atvainojiet, ka atmetu šo /sノ( ゜-゜ノ)	24
Vīrieši ir vissliktākie.	2
Kaut kā savādi, viņi savā laikrakstā uztur piespraužamo sadaļu. Ne tā, kā tas jebkad būtu bijis vajadzīgs nevienam no uzticamiem provinces laikrakstiem.	27
Jūs nekad neesat bijis Anglijā, vai ne?	7
Vienkārši pastāstiet viņai, kā jūtaties, un veiciet nākamo soli	27
Labi, es atzīšos. ES smējos.	1
Pēc tam veiciet citronu... ceļojums ilgst 3-4 stundas, bet ir ļoti spēcīgs	27
Viņa pagājušajā gadā balsoja pret 700 miljardu dolāru budžetu. Tomēr viņas nacionālās drošības uzskati kopumā ir miglaini. Es par viņiem neko daudz nezinu.	27
JO TAM IR PIEVIENOTS IZSLĒGŠANA! KĀ TO NESAŅEMT?	2,7
Sveiki visiem! Šī ir mana 13 minūšu asa sižeta/komēdijas īsfilma, SULĪGI! Ceru, ka jums visiem patiks! Atsauksmes ir apsveicamas.	20
CBP šeit dara lielisku darbu. Ir vērts dot viņiem naudu, nevar sagaidīt, kad varēs doties ciemos	0
Mēs vai nu cīnāmies par uzvaru izbraukumā, vai arī piedzīvosim kārtējo vēsturisko sabrukumu	27
Cik pretenciozs, sevi reklamējošs ieraksts.	0
Kāds tiek atlaists	2
Es nesatiekos ar sievietēm, kuras smēķē. Kas attiecas uz tabletēm vai šļircēm utt., man nešķiet pievilcīgi izklaidējoši narkotiku lietotāji. Līdzīgi par būšanu piedzēries.	3,10
wow, mēs tiešām dzīvojam nākotnē	0,13
Tas, papildus manai jau tā briesmīgajai garīgajai veselībai, ir iemesls, kāpēc man ir ļoti mazs svars un man ir vajadzīga palīdzība.	25
Priecīgu kūku dienu!	13
Tā kā jūs mani izsaucāt par to, ka es aizstāvu uzbrucēju, vienkārši norādiet, kurš teikums, kuru es uzrakstīju, noveda jūs pie šāda secinājuma.	27
Turklāt tu aizmirsi labāko daļu... Es varu pakārt rokas no ārējās vestes	27
Ak mans [NAME] Es gandrīz aizmirsu par asajiem dr pipariem stikla glāzē	22,26
Šķiet, ka es to ievietoju. Ak nē!	12,22
LOL nē, tas nav viss video. Tagad mēs visi esam redzējuši garo video, tāpēc ir skaidrs, ka man bija taisnība.	1,4
Es domāju...tas ir diezgan pašsaprotami. Es tikai domāju, kas ir otrs. 2/10	26
Rezultāts virs zem virzuļiem 87,5	27
Tie puiši ir STIPRI. priecājos redzēt Blekvoteru atpakaļ biznesā, lai saglabātu mieru	0
Vēlos arī norādīt, ka cīnītājs patiesībā ir karavīra sinonīms.	27
Valsts vai brīvība, jebkurā gadījumā PR būtu labāki nekā sūdu šovs, kas bija [NAME]	27
Paldies. Es izlasīšu šos	15
Godīgi sakot, Teksasa ir pelnījusi uzvarēt ar savu spēli, viņi noteikti bija motivēti un pārspēj UGA abās bumbas pusēs.	0
Manā vietā [NAME], nevis [NAME], taču priecājos, ka [NAME] klājas labi.	17
Jo viņa gribēja paskatīties uz amerikāņu meitenēm lol	27
Es uzdodu jums šo jautājumu: &quot;Kā jūs zināt, ka [RELIGION] nav īstā reliģija?&quot;	2,7
Haha, izskatās.	1
Man nav kauna teikt, ka man joprojām ir mana sega no bērnības. Un mīļākais plīša [NAME].	21
VAI ZINĀJĀT, KA INDIJAS RŪKSTIŅI NODAS NO AUGĻA!?!?	7
Ja pēc šaušanas turat nospiestu slēdzi, ar bultskrūves palīdzību jūs neatceļat darbības jomu	27
Ak, labi, tam ir liela jēga. Bet jums ir pilnīga taisnība, mums ir jāstrādā pēc iespējas vairāk.	4
Draugs, šī noteikti ir izceļošanas krāpniecība. Es izgāju cauri kraukšķīgajam sabrukumam, šī sajūta ir tieši tāda pati. Nevajadzētu paiet 30 h, lai iegūtu 1 btc.	27
Es nekad nepievilšu, vienkārši pajautā savai mātei. ;)	27
Vai jūs varat doties viņu redzēt klātienē?	7
Viņam kādā brīdī būs jādodas prom. Tikpat labi varētu viņu nogādāt klubā, kur nevajag viņu nicināt	27
Vai es šeit esmu vienīgais INTP, kuram rūp termiņi. Tas ir tas, kā man tik labi padevās krīze un strādāju pēdējā brīdī.	27
Esmu bijis tikai vienu reizi, bet mēs novietojām automašīnu pie Publix, kas atrodas pāris jūdžu attālumā, un Uber mūs izsēdināja pie vārtiem. Tas bija ideāls	27
Kreisajā pusē esošā emblēma izskatās kā slepkava kundze Puff no spongebob.	27
Man tas šķiet salīdzināms: arī es baidos no sevis.	14
Bijis izslēgts kopš 29. novembra. Es labprātāk strādātu un pelnītu naudu. Mājās kļūst garlaicīgi	9
Šausmīgi skumjš stāsts. Man tas patika.	18,25
uzdzirksti brālis. Laipni lūdzam.	15
Jā, tas izklausās pēc parastā Sietlas atteikuma.	4
Dillija dillīte!	27
Tas ir patiešām noderīgi, paldies!	15
Pft, nemēdz sevi.	27
Šobrīd tā šķiet laba lieta, bet ne lieliska lieta. Es to nemīlu... Bet es to neienīstu.	10
Mani bērni absolvēja koledžu pirms diviem gadiem. Domāju, ka es to palaidu garām?	7,22
varam tikai cerēt	20
Mani bloķēja vecajā kontā bez redzama iemesla vairākus mēnešus pēc tam, kad biju tur ievietojis pēdējo reizi.	9,27
Viņi saņem pudeli vai es saņemu pudeli... var arī dalīties ar bagātību	4,27
Šķiet, ka mēs atradām viņa dabisko stāvokli.	13
Jā, tas palīdz. Paldies :)	15
WAS vienmēr var samaksāt tirdzniecības kicker. Bet es esmu gatavs izmest tikai [NAME] viņa labā. Nav nožēlojams par atteikšanos no DFS.	27
Apakšējais komentārs: &gt;Nokārtošana ir zelta standarts, kas nosaka, vai jūs atbilstat vīrieša vai sievietes sociālajai lomai. [NAME], cik regresīvi.	6
Tagad jums ir 3 pavedieni par šo pēdējo 10 stundu laikā. Izvēlieties vienu un pieturieties pie tā.	3
[NAME], drāž [NAME], vai jūs esat pabeidzis, tomēr esat rasistisks, jūs nepalīdzat sabiedrībai	11
Es esmu 5&#39;6&quot; un trīs ceturtdaļas haha. Man tomēr ir mati.	27
Lieliska atvērto datu izmantošana. Patīk lietotne.	0
ak, mans ļaunais	9
Lai kas tas arī būtu, to pat nav vērts dzirdēt	27
Es mīlu Steipltonu. [NAME] vienmēr ir bijis uzticīgs autentiskajai skaņai, lai gan IMO, viņš noteikti izceļas.	18
Ir labi uztraukties par lietām, kuras var palīdzēt. Lol	1
Es atradu zobārstu (Aspen Dental), kurš īsziņā vai e-pastā apstiprina katru tikšanos, un manā ārsta kabinetā ir lietotne visam, sākot no tikšanās līdz recepšu uzpildīšanai.	4,27
Puišiem arī jāzina, ka ne katra sieviete ir izmēra karaliene. Vidējais nenozīmē nestandarta, vidējais nozīmē tikai pareizi.	27
Bašs, kas neko negarantē? Vai tas nav slikts, es domāju, ka tā ir viena no sūdzībām, ko dzirdēju par likumdevēju bāzi	7
Es neesmu pārliecināts, es neprotu izteikt savas jūtas, un dažreiz es dusmojos un saku lietas, kas ļoti aizvaino	2
Amerika zaudēs. Jūs esat garīgi izjaukts un ienaidnieks.	27
Tikpat droši, kā dieviem ir sandales, tā pārspēj kaujas puišus ar dārgumu takām	27
Paldies tev!	15
Kas? Pat viņa komentārs bija saistīts ar suņu matiem.	7,22
Cilvēk, tas izklausās pēc lielas lietas. Lai veicas sakārtot	20
Lindt ir augstākās klases zīmols, mani tas nepārsteidz.	27
Lūdzu, sniedziet piemēru ar pavisam citu nozīmi. Trūkst konteksta, ko jūs domājat ar atšķirīgu.	27
Ir tas, ko augi alkst.	27
Tātad jūs sakāt, ka [NAME] nav personīga atriebības pret mani?	27
Kaķi ir atbaidoši un nav pelnījuši būt par mājdzīvniekiem	10,11
Nē, tā būtu vēl viena kļūda.	10
Tas viss [NAME] mazliet &quot;Es tevi neizvarošu. Es esmu mazs zēns.&quot; savādi ir mērķtiecīgi.	27
Man ir skumji par botu. Viņi vēlas tikai mērķi	25
Viņu oficiālā loģika ir tāda, ka tas samazina apgrozījumu, bet jā, citi iemesli ir acīmredzami.	27
Man patīk šī atbilde. Es nevaru jums dot zeltu, bet man ir goda zelts.	0,18
Cilvēki sadusmojās par to, ka Apple konkursa ietvaros iegūst fotoattēlus bez autoratlīdzības, tāpēc tagad Apple faktiski maksā cilvēkiem.	27
Esmu ļoti sajūsmā par tevi!! Es pašlaik nesatiekos, bet man patīk dzirdēt, ka kāds ir nežēlīgs.	13,18
Es faktiski tiku iepazīstināts ar hbomb un breadtube kopumā, jo [NAME] vid uz ds2. Paldies [NAME]?	15
Kāpēc tika pieņemts, ka Kitchens izrādīsies labāks nekā JBC? Scenāriji šķiet ļoti līdzīgi	6
&gt; Porno, ko es lejupielādēju, ražoja Brazzers. Ja jūs nezināt, Brazzers ir ***anāls*** par viņu IP. Ha saņemties fucked.	1,11,22
Es ceru, ka jūs saņemsit garīgo palīdzību, kas jums noteikti ir nepieciešama.	20
[NAME] ir fenomenāls. Tā būs skumja diena, kad viņš būs prom	9,25
Šie bērni, kas iejaucas, noķers &#39;baišos spokus&#39;	27
Varbūt jūs vienkārši esat ārkārtīgi garlaicīgs un mīlīgs un tieši atsakāties mācīties uzņemt fotogrāfijas, kas nav nepatīkamas.	10
Tas bija taisnīgi	4
Ak, tas ir pat virsrakstā! Paldies.	15
Nē paldies.	15
&gt; Ziņkārības pēc, vai esat lasījis lorda rabīna [NAME] Lielo partnerību? ES neesmu. Bet es klausos viņa parsha podcast.	7
Interesanti, es to nezināju. Paldies par TIL! Vai jūs varētu ieteikt kādus resursus, kas to sīkāk apspriestu?	15
&gt; Tā ir tikai laika izšķiešana. Tāpat kā likt Portlendas iedzīvotājiem izmantot savus nodokļu dolārus, lai uzbūvētu stadionu	9,10
Cik cienījamas sievietes.	0
Tas ir skaisti. Es domāju, ka man ir jāpārvietojas. 😊	0,20

Kreiļi par to priecājas	17
Sēdies jaunais ragewalker.	13
Bruklinas-Bostonas izslēgšanas spēles būtu visu laiku toksiskākā lieta. Sliktāk būtu tikai Sixers-Cs	2,11,27
Jo tās nav dažādas pasugas	27
Tā nav vardarbība pret politiskajiem oponentiem, ja tā ir pret tirānu, kuru jūs definējat kā politisko pretinieku	27
Lieliska vietne. Nekad neesmu par to dzirdējis. Paldies, ka devāt līdzi!	0,15
Vienīgā problēma ir tā, ka jūs nekad nedzirdēsit par viņu attiecībām, izmantojot sponsorēšanu.	9
Pēdējā laikā esmu ļoti aizrāvies ar zinātnisko literatūru, un senā reliģijas vēsture izklausās aizraujoši! Vai jums ir kādas grāmatas, ko ieteiktu?	7
Droši vien izsita arī viņa eļļas pannu, es tai mašīnai dotu 3 jūdzes dzīvot.	27
Nē, es domāju, ka jūs vienkārši jūtaties pārliecināti, jo jums ir stingrs līgums par šīm drēbēm! Es justos tāpat!	4
Bērni sirdī.	27
Dvīņi.. man pirmo reizi ir bērns, un man ir dvīņi. Šis būs brauciens lol	1
Es taču to esmu darījis visu savu dzīvi...	27
haha jā. Paldies. Nekādu negadījumu, tāpēc gāja labi 😂😂	4,15
Mēs ar vīru gadiem riņķojam pa kanalizāciju. :(	25
Man bija GB 1999. gadā, un tas bija sliktāk nekā mana dēla piedzimšana. Es labprāt būtu bijusi piedurkne....	18
Svētās balles! Es ceru, ka tas ir tavs kaimiņš.	20
Tas ir tāpēc, ka pievilcīgiem cilvēkiem parasti nav jāpiestrādā pie savas personības	27
Viņi neiebilst pret otru trumpi, ja [NAME] 2020 šķiet ticams	27
Seksuālā kontrasta labad.	27
Vai jūs runājat par izlīdzināšanas maksājumiem? Jo BC nesaņem izlīdzināšanas maksājumus.	7
Man vairāk žēl, ka ir īsti [NAME] fani...	24
Sapa ir diezgan labs, bet Takashi ir līdz šim labākās kvalitātes suši Soltleikā.	0
Nu vēl divi tuvākie testētāji ir patiešām sarūgtināti par ripošanu	9
Tas mani aizkustināja ar labām atmiņām	17
Man tas patika gandrīz tikpat ļoti, cik man patīk pārāk daudz pintes.	17
VIENĪGĀS BAUMAS, KAS ES KAD ESMU DZIRDĒTS, IR VAI MEKLĒŠANAS FUNKCIJA PASTĀV. SPOILERA BRĪDINĀJUMS: IR.	4
Neviens neapgalvo, ka 20. gadsimta sociālisms bija utopija. Pirms atbildes, lūdzu, atcerieties savu komentāru.	3
Diemžēl, ja meklējat spēles informāciju par Detroitas basketbola komandu, atrodaties nepareizā vietā.	22,25

Tas ir vienkārši tik mīļi! Tas ir viss. :). Tik salds.	0
No Piena Ceļa neviens vēl nav pametis pļāvēju dēļ. Nav iespējams, ka neviens neiekļuva tā paša iemesla vai līdzīga lokalizētāka iemesla dēļ	27
Man šķita interesanti, ka [NAME] netika uzrunāts FA vai līdz vēlākajām drafta kārtām.	7
Grim Reaver!!!	27
Kāpēc taisīt to par video? Varēja būt tikai teksta ziņa.	7
Lūdzam meklēt medicīnisko palīdzību	5
700 eiro nedēļā par 16 stundu dienām 6-7 dienas nedēļā ir sūdi un krietni zem minimālās algas, ja to strādā stundā.	9,27
Ja viņiem patiešām ir vairāk pierādījumu, ka viņš bija dziļāks, nekā sākotnēji tika aizdomas, tad man nav līdzjūtības.	27
Mani draugi, kuri bija smagi ievainoti no pirmās cīņas. Izlasi manu aizmugurstāsta komentāru.	25
Es nezinu, kāpēc, bet tas lika man tik smagi salauzties!	6
Noslaukiet tos visus!	27
Nē, persona, kas jūs apkalpo, jau ir uzrādījusi personu apliecinošu dokumentu, lai iegūtu darbu, tātad viņi jau ir apstiprinājuši savu vecumu	27
Ak jā. Tālāk ir sniegta informācija par Personu.	27
Šķiršanās ir smaga. Ceru ka jūties labāk.	5
Tie ir tie paši cilvēki, kuri uzskatīja, ka karstās mērces patikšana ir liels skandāls	27
Es vēlos, lai tā būtu lieta 🙄	8,20
Es to uztveršu tikai kā idiotu vienību metaforu.	27
Jā, es ieteiktu to, noteikti vienkāršs pulkstenis	4
Tas man atgādina Persija Džeksona sēriju :P viņi vienā brīdī dara to pašu, kad viņi apmeklē dambi :P	27
Viņam ir 3 gadi pirmās komandas menedžera amatā, līgumu viņš parakstīja novembrī, bet tas nav svarīgi	27
Mana doma bija tāda, ka tas ir rāpojoši. Es nekad neesmu teicis, ka tas ir nelikumīgi.	10
Tas ir lielisks salīdzinājums	0
Pirmkārt, es esmu pret valdības periodu, un, otrkārt, es to nododu zem satīras kārtas, lai idejas vieglāk izplatītos	10
Btw- man patīk tava nojauta!	18
omgad tas briesmonis!	27
um kā būtu ar neiesaistīšanos un aiziešanu?	3,27
Vai [NAME] interesējas par rudmatēm? [NAME] vēlētos ar jums parunāt.	18
Šī meitene netika uzmākta. Viņa bija jauna (juridiska) meitene, kurai šķita forši satikties ar kādu viņas tēva vecumu	4
[NAME] šodien ir lieliski, kad viņš šādi spēlē, viņš ir ļoti labs spēlētājs	0
Vai jums ir balsošanas saite? Iegāju NHL mājaslapā, bet neko neredzēju.	6
Mans dumjais dupsis domāja, ka tas ir paredzēts kā burvju nūjiņa, un viņš apgrieza laiku, un es biju patiešām apmulsusi.	6

es tevi nolādēju	2
Nav pietiekami daudz precīzu datu par [NAME] civilo, lai paliktu uzticīgi savai identitātei, ja vien viņi nevēlas izveidot ar spāņu iebrukumu saistītu sižetu.	27
Ak, tas patiesībā ir nopietns atvieglojums, tomēr kā jūs to zināt?	7,23
Manuprāt, viņi strādā ar vecākiem cilvēkiem	27
Junkies, kas tur klīst, var izjokot dažus labus jokus par to, ka viņi kļūst par bēdu	27
Oooo redzu, es cerēju, ka tā nav troļļa lieta, likās tiešām bezgaumīgi.	10
Vai kāds var apstiprināt [NAME] piemērotību? Prasu pēc drauga.	27
Tieši tad viņi pirms darba uzvāra savu otro kausu, haha	1

Manā vietējā Walmart veikalā ir puisis, kurš izskatās pēc [NAME]	27
Mans viedoklis ir tāds, ka ikviens pietiekami gudrs vienkārši nedarbotos [NAME].	3
Tas nekas. Kādu dienu tu nebūsi tik skumjš un dusmīgs, un cilvēki joprojām tevi pieņems.	5
Šķiet, ka [NAME] ir atgriezies kā kaķis.	27
Tas ir pārsteigums no šī puiša.	26
Kāds brīnišķīgs stāsts! Liels paldies par dalīšanos, kas lika man pasmaidīt.	0,15
Vai kāds zina, cik ādai vajadzētu maksāt? Rediģēt: Un vai tas uzklāj losjonu uz ādas?	7
Es mīlu savus bērnus. Man ne vienmēr patīk mani bērni, bet es viņus mīlu.	10,18

Paldies, cilvēk🌱	15
Vai tas tomēr nav ar pelēm? Es varētu kļūdīties vai varbūt tās žurkas un peles. Rediģēt: jo īpaši lauka peles.	6,27
Ļoti stulbi, ka cilvēki jūs negatīvi vērtē par labticīga jautājuma uzdošanu.	3,10

[NAME] dzīvo savu labāko dzīvi Vācijā.	17
Es to palaidu garām, domājot par vēlmēm, un es cerēju, ka viņi nedaudz apvienosies	8,20
Nē, es nevēlos, lai tas VISPĀR būtu nelaimīgs vai neveselīgs, tikai vairāk kā normāls/nepatīkams mazulis.	10
[NAME] toreiz bija tik mīļāks. Arī WOW tā intervija ir raudoša	0
Ļoti legāli un forši	4
Man patīk tās visas, atkarībā no tā, ko vēlos mācīties. Man ļoti patīk [NAME] un [NAME] stils, jo viņi ir tādi troļļi.	3,18
Kāda kamuflāža?	6
Un labāk, sasodīts, nāc tur agri! Izdevīgi pircēji nedrāžas.	3
Un viņa ir ignorējusi katru no tiem, kā, protams, gaidīts.	3
Pārliecinieties, ka viņš saņem glikozamīnu (!)	27
Bi cilvēkus var piesaistīt arī trans un nebināri cilvēki.	4,22
Es domāju, ka tas ir viņa brālis?	7
Pēc viņa komentāra es teiktu, ka viņš patiesībā ir vienkāršs cilvēks. Tātad, par vēlu.	3
Tas ir vēl sliktāk, ja jūs saņemat kādu no NJ, kuram nav ne jausmas, kā braukt pilsētas vidē.	11
Tas ir .... tas ir diezgan normāli ... kaut kur 280 jūdžu attālumā ... Ja jums nav degvielu taupošas automašīnas, to nav grūti izdarīt.	27
Toreiz man bija milzīga simpātija par galveno dziedātāju. Joprojām nezinu, par ko ir šī dziesma, bet man tā patīk.	18
Tiešām? Man patīk šī izrāde	18
pareizi. [NAME] bija mūsu 3. kārtas izvēle. Roka izskatās pēc melnraksta nozagšanas	4
Es domāju, ka [NAME] valdība būtu daudz sliktāka nekā Brexit.	27
&gt; ēd viņu treneris	27
Tas, ka jums tas ir jāpaskaidro trešās klases līmenī, ir nožēlojami. Cilvēki domā, ka kāds, kas novērš savu slepkavību, ir traģēdija.	25
Būs skumji, kad Gameday būs sporta zālē, kur tiek šauts. Man jau pietrūkst CFB :(	25
Es būtu domājis, ka jā.	27
&quot;Kādam no mums būs taisnība!&quot; Vai arī... jūs kļūdāties un izšķērdējat savu enerģiju, būdami stulbi, nevis baudījāt.	3,10
Šķiet, ka jūs par to esat diezgan sarūgtināts. Tas nav e-pasts, tas ir formāls pieteikums. Mani tomēr nepārsteidz, ka tu to nesaproti.	9
Šķiet, ka jūs varētu redzēt komēdijas filmā.	1,27
Nenožēlo laiku, ja tas būtu bijis agrāk, iespējams, ka tev nebūtu bērnu vai trīs!	4
Tam es piekrītu	4

Mans bijušais ar BPD man to teica par savu bijušo. Viņi ir šķirti gandrīz gadu.	27
Tu nekļūdies	4
Man patīk Pērta!!!! Kāpēc neviens cits nesteidzas par šo pilsētu?	18
Jums taisnība, ar mani tā notiek katru reizi	4
Jā, tas neko nenozīmē. Tas ir maciņš, ko viņi ir izmantojuši citā biržā, un viņi to izmanto, lai nosūtītu jums naudu.	27
Vai es izspiegoju šo Arcade klubu? Man tur patīk!	0,7,18
Ak, man ir tie džinsi	27
tad tev veiksies labi!	4,5,27
Tad tie izklausās kaut kā nav tā vērti. Vismaz lielie neizklausās tā vērti. Jums ir mana līdzjūtība.	5
Tāda pati reakcija man bija pagājušajā nedēļā, kad uzzināju, ka [NAME] savulaik bija saderinājusies ar [NAME].	26
Tas nav porno lol	1
Nē, es domāju, ka viņi pēc tam aizmirst un uzdeva papildu jautājumu. Būtībā padarot situāciju smieklīgāku.	1
Lūdzu dari!	27
Esmu skaudības pilna. Labprāt tiktu pie tādas naudas! Bet es nesaskatu tajā problēmu.	8,9
Satriecošs! Es nesen pēc pasūtījuma izgatavoju mākslas darbu savai razer panthera! To noteikti ir ļoti jautri darīt! 👍	0,1,4
Jā, viņi, iespējams, vēlētos vairāk nekā [NAME] un [NAME]. [NAME], varbūt [NAME] var arī viņus izsmalcināt lol	27
Mēs ar savu līgavaini devāmies uz draugu māju un vienkārši pavadījām laiku līdz pusnaktij un skatījāmies uguņošanu, tas bija tik forši un ideāli!	17

Pat šis tvīts smaržo tikai pēc sniegtā apraksta (un tā, kā viņas draugiem ir jāizskatās/smaržo). Es rīstījos.	27
Es to daru, bet es cukuroju diskrēti un patiesi baidos, ka tas var tikt apdraudēts jomas dēļ, kurā strādāju.	14
Jūs aizmirsāt sava vārda priekšā ievietot &quot;atzveltnes krēsls&quot;.	27
Man šajā nedēļas nogalē ir konsultācijas... nekas nav jābaidās... vienkārši pastāstiet viņiem par savām jūtām un to, par ko jūs uztraucaties.	5
Tas ir rasisms. Tas mani nesadusmo, tas liek man justies līdzi par viņu un jūsu nezināšanu.	3
Vienkārši panāc viņam priekšā un apstājies	27
Paldies!!	15
ES piekrītu.	4
Vai... Vai šis ir Hitmena tēmas FE Shitpost?...Es nezinu, vai tas būtu laimīgs vai pārsteigts.	17

Tik ļoti vientuļi	25
Acīmredzot mēs esam traģēdijas!	27
Tagad [NAME] ir populārākais!	27
Viņš bija ASV prokurors un Ņujorkas mērs. Viņš nav idiots un precīzi zina, ko dara.	4
Jā, atkal šis muļķis.	27
Es skatos leģendas un lol, jā, mēs visi zinām, ka viņa pastāvēja / radās nākotnē. Es arī zinu, ka šis [NAME] atšķiras no [NAME].	1,4

bet [NAME] saka, ka tas rada vilšanos	27
Ak [NAME]. Bet es esmu neizpratnē par to, kā tika uzņemta bilde, atvainojos, ja tu tā teici, bet es esmu mazliet stulbs un noguris	6

Labi, paldies.	15

Liels paldies, es noteikti palaidu to garām, kamēr man nebija regulāras piekļuves internetam. Atvainojiet, ka kļūdas dēļ iekļāvu jūs sarakstā.	15
Žēl to redzēt kā vienreizēju. Šķiet, ka [NAME] ļoti izbauda spēli un pašu. Izmēģinās spēli.	27

Man ir nopietnas bailes kļūt vējā, šis video lika manām bumbiņām nokrist	14
Gatavs. Laba atbrīvošanās. Paldies par komentāru	15
Jā. Ja mēs nenākam klajā ar risinājumu, nav vajadzīgi risinājumi nekam citam.	4
Tas ir ļoti kaitinoši tikai tad, ja tas ir pārāk lēns	3
Komentāri par šo pavedienu ir tādi, kādus es gaidīju, un tas mani skumdina.	25
jā, viņam bija 6 rezultatīvas piespēles, kas radīja 13 punktus, ja viņam būtu 13 punkti un neviena piespēle, cilvēki to nosauktu par lielisku spēli viņam	10

Interesanti, cik daudz krājumu paņēmāt?	7
Nirstiet tajā saldajā labestībā, draugs. Apskatiet tikšanos ar sievieti, kurai ir paveicies būt jūsu tuvumā, un tas kļūst daudz vienkāršāk.	5,18
Šis r/dbdgonevild/	27
Es esmu [NAME], un paklupšana ir tikai stiprinājusi manu ticību. Katram savs.	27
Kāpēc es tagad to visur redzu? Tas nebija manā vārdu krājumā pagājušajā nedēļā.	6
Es, godīgi sakot, paredzu 2011. gada mēroga nemierus, ja mēs piedzīvosim bezvienošanās Brexit — iespējams, vēl sliktāk. Tas ir biedējoši.	14
*Hei, tikko pamanīju..* tā ir tava **1. kūkas diena** plankumainais grifs! ^(apskāviens)	22
Oho, tas nav labi	10
Es esmu ar jums, piemēram, vai mums nevajadzētu kādam piezvanīt vai pārliecināties, ka tas tika ievērots? Šis nabaga puisis.	7,9
Es vēlos piebilst, ka spontāni piedzīvojāt nebeidzamu riebumu pret sevi, jo jūs pēkšņi atcerējāties to apkaunojošo lietu, ko darījāt pirms 3 gadiem.	22
es zvanu [NAME] noms ar [NAME] [NAME]	27

Nē, tā nav. Tie ir meli. [NAME] nav tālu pa labi. ASV nevienu nav &quot;instalējusi&quot;.	27
Kāpēc jūs mēģināt to darīt? Kas notiek?	6
Es esmu mēģinājis pēc iespējas vairāk atturēties no vārda “[RELIGION]” lietošanas, lai ievērotu pašreizējo baznīcas stila ceļvedi.	27
Labāk esi!	27

Es nezinu, ko teikt, es tik un tā pateikšu	6
Es tikai paskaidroju, kāpēc viss balsojums ar maka lietu īsti neattiecas.	27
Nē, mūsdienās visvairāk balsotie stāsti par nāsīm ir par seksuālu vardarbību vai kaut ko līdzīgu	27
GAA nav sports...	10
Paldies, man izdevās justies labāk, ļaujot atraisīt mūziku — noteikti *daudz* labāks veids, kā izkļūt no niršanas.	15
Neaizmirstiet, ka tajā bija Kailija 1.0!	27
Lieli kāpumi. Mazās lietas rada atšķirību.	27

Nu ja mēs tikai sāktu otro ceturtdaļu abās spēlēs...būtu iznākuši priekšā!	22
Man žēl, ka tas notika ar jums. Es tiešām nevaru iedomāties.	25
Lūk, [NAME] kungs, jūs neēdīsit visu to arbūzu.	10,27
Ar jums viss ir kārtībā, ikviens, kurš ir bijis jūsu situācijā, būtu reaģējis tāpat. Šis komentētājs tikai mēģina likt jums justies slikti.	5
Tas ir vienkārši, es jautāju, un viņa meloja.	27
Es tiešām priecājos par jums! Mēs arī rakstījām dažas nedēļas pirms tikšanās! Pirmie apskāvieni un skūpsti bija vislabākie!	13
Tavs bargākais kritiķis vienmēr būsi tu pats	27
Tas ir daudz vārdu, lai pateiktu: &quot;Es esmu sarūgtināts, ka sievietes nevēlas ar mani satikties.&quot;	9
tās ir diezgan normālas domas depresīviem cilvēkiem	27
Jā, jo neviens vīrietis nekad nav ticis nepatiesi ieslodzīts apsūdzību dēļ, kas vēlāk izrādījās nepatiesas	2
Mēs viņiem dodam pārāk daudz naudas.	27
To ir tik daudz! Tante [NAME] un dāma [NAME] ir divas no labākajām. Bet personīgi basģitārists no Spiderbait [NAME].	27

Es nevaru saprast, kāpēc Pepsi un Coke ir divi populārākie gāzētie dzērieni. Vai arī kāpēc fani domā, ka viņi ir tik atšķirīgi.	6,22
Es domāju, ka mums vajadzētu veikt pētījumu un noskaidrot, pretējā gadījumā es nezinu un jūs arī nezināt	6

Viņš nevarēja bloķēt šāvienu, ja tas bija no manas mirušās vecmāmiņas	27
Es baidos sēdēt ar viņiem un netikt sadzirdēts. Bet manas drošības dēļ tas var būt jādara.	14
Kāpēc mēs nevaram darīt abus, apstiprināt sienas finansējumu un vairāk robežu aģentu tagad un pārtraukt turēt ķīlniekus 800 000 federālo darbinieku?	27
JAUTĀ UN SAŅEMSI	27
Es alkstu fizisku kontaktu. Es kļūstu aizkaitināms, ja pārāk ilgi iztieku bez tā, kas ir pretrunā ar to, ka man arī patīk būt vienatnē.	6
No šī leņķa viņa seja izskatās kā liela auguma puisis no Džērsija krasta.	27

Es domāju, ka daži no viņiem sagaida, ka pie katra reģistra vienmēr kā statuja stāvēs kasieris, lai cik lēns būtu bizness!	27
Un šie nodarījumi nav Kriminālkodeksa pārkāpumi. Kriminālkodeksa noziedzīgie nodarījumi paredz, ka &quot;neapšaubāmi&quot;, vai apsūdzētais patiešām izdarījis nodarījumu.	27

Es neesmu pārliecināts, vai mēs tagad FIB un Jūras spēku vārdus uztveram kā likumīgus avotus vai kas šeit notiek, lol?	1
Viņi ir lieliski!	0
Ak 100%. Un es redzēju, ka [NAME] un [NAME] abi izvēlējās [NAME] iemeslu, kā viņa vēlējās spēlēt spēli.	4
Nevarētu piekrist vairāk. Personīgi man patīk skatīties jebkuru profesionālu komponistu. GOATS ir jautri vērot mikrospēli un spēju laikus un sinerģiju	10,18
Reakcija ir neticama. Esmu diezgan pārliecināts, ka tā ir arī satīra, taču tās ietekme ir nomācoša.	9,25
Tas nenozīmē, ka mēs nevaram uzlabot to, kas mums ir	10
Interesanti. Interesanti, kā tas darbojas. Vai tas pats veic mijmaiņas darījumus? Vai tas izmanto valūtas maiņas sarakstus? Es to pārbaudīšu vēlāk.	13
Šķietami tā ir diezgan lieljaudas piekabe, taču tā noteikti rada zināmu slodzi uz gultņu bloku, tādā veidā ietriecot tajā baļķi uz sāniem.	27
Lol šīs lietas faktiskais stāvoklis. Nekas nepareizs, norādot, ka [NAME] ir gudra sniegpārsla. Pieņemsim, ka tas mainīs jūsu parastās sieviešu naidīgās ziņas.	1
Nūjas prasmju trūkums [NAME] patiesībā ir pārsteidzošs.	26
Man ir skumji, vai kāds var man likt justies labāk. Jūtos kā sūdi, es vienkārši gribu atgriezties [NAME]	25
300 partneru pārpalikums un aizsardzības nelietošana man ir nepievilcīgi, es nevēlos neko noķert	10
Redzēja, ka šis rezultāts nāk. Diemžēl labākais rezultāts mums un mežsargiem.	0,4
vienkārši atvainojies. kādu citu padomu jūs varētu prasīt? tu izdrāzēji, tagad tiec galā.	2,24
Ko jūs domājat ar smalkiem ziediem?	6,7
Taču mēs saņēmām lielisku tranzīta līniju no centra uz lidostu, turklāt lielākā daļa olimpisko objektu pastāvēja pirms spēlēm.	0
Vai man nav jābūt tam, ko vēlos? Ko man vajag?!?	3,6
Kas ir četri līgumi?	27
Kurš?	27
*Nākamajā dienā nelietoju kosmētiku* &quot;Vai tev viss kārtībā? Tu izskaties slims.&quot;	27
Ak, mans [NAME], kāpēc es paskatījos?	27
Jā, es domāju, ka neviens cits nekad nav slēdzis valdību.	27
Viņi izmanto to, ka jūs atradāt šo pavedienu un sapratāt, ka jums ir jādara vēl viena diena, līdz to saņemsit.	22
Tikai uz nedēļu? Tu esi liels optimists!	7
Cik bloķējis [NAME]	27
Tas nebūs, tas apturēs tos, kas šķērso robežu. Nav ļoti grūts jēdziens.	4
Jā. Es biju sajūsmā par iespēju iegūt jaunu [NAME], ja viņš iekļūs pēdējais, bet es nodošu tālāk šos neglītos krekliņus.	13
Es mīlu šo wow	18
To varēja izdarīt divos paneļos, un, godīgi sakot, tas mani kaitina visvairāk	3
Viens no maniem kolēģiem iekļuva gaidīšanas sarakstā. Lielisks puisis, bet jā, tā ir situācija, kas kļūst arvien bagātāka.	0
Labi, es mēģināšu tādu atrast. Piedod par to.	24
Es iznīcināju apmēram 1/2 no tām, jo melnās čūskas patiesībā ir laba lieta, kas atrodas tuvumā. Es vienkārši negribēju to pārāk daudz.	4
Jums nav jāienīst spēlētāji tikai tāpēc, ka esat citā komandā. Es ienīstu, ka [NAME] ir [NAME]. Es neienīstu [NAME]	10
Ejiet ar viņu, ēdiet arī veselīgu pārtiku. Tas var palīdzēt	4,5
mēs ejam!	27
Ak, mans [NAME]	26
Dude ieguva īpašumā glāzi sidra. Viņš pavadīja veselu mēnesi, rūdīdamies un griežot zobus eksistenciālā murgā sulfītu dēļ.	27
[NAME] vienkārši vēlas publicēt attēlus, kuros viņa ir noskaņota, lai pievērstu uzmanību, vienlaikus uzvedoties morāli pārāka par citām meitenēm. nost	2
Viņam ir arī draudzene, par kuru šķiet, ka viņš patiešām rūpējas...	5
Varbūt viņi ir greizsirdīgi, ka jūs atradāt laimi.	27
Priecājos, ka izveidojāt Reddit kontu, lai informētu mūs par to, cik ļoti jums ir vienalga	17
Uz nākamo!	27
Man ir bail par to runāt ar savu vadītāju	14
Viņi paši izmeklēs, un nekas nenotiks. Detroitas policija apkauno visus. Un viņi brīnās, kāpēc viņi nevienam nepatīk, viņus ciena, vai kāpēc cilvēki bēg no viņiem.	3
[NAME] šajā spēlē daudz uzbrūk grozam, labi redzēt.	17,27
Šis ir vecs karnijas triks. Ir vietnes, kas ir atmaskojušas šo puisi.	27
Labākie lielā fināla zaudētāji, ko menca jebkad redzējusi	0
Ikreiz, kad man sanāk kādu apskaut.	17
Ak, grilēti tīrradņi. Īsti neesmu tos redzējis ātrās ēdināšanas vietās, tāpēc man šķita, ka tie ir tikai parastie tīrradņi	26
Tas ir pārsteidzoši, cilvēk. Izsitiet dupsi, pagatavojiet labu ēdienu, saņemiet samaksu. Apsveicu	0,15
Par ko tu runā?	27
Paskaties, [NAME] ir šeit &quot;Kur pie velna viņš bija pirms stundas, Gerij, kur!?&quot;	2,7
Es reiz redzēju šo fanu attēlu, kur [NAME] ir uzzīmēts kā [NAME], un tas ir smieklīgi, jo viņi abi ir mani iecienītākie personāži gan filmās Persona, gan Jojo	18
Apsveicu!!! Tas būšu es maijā, un es nevaru vien sagaidīt!	15
Tas bija arī sāpīgs satricinājums. Vai mēs esam mazohisti?	25
Un viņi to nedarīs, kamēr tas viņus nepiemeklēs – vai pat tad, kaut kā vainojot to arī uz citiem.	27
Ak, šis trāpa mājās	0
joprojām būtu lieliski. it īpaši, ja mēs iegūstam [NAME] no Denveras arī FA	27
Man žēl. Vai varat, lūdzu, paskaidrot, kuri ir 2 izveidošanas secības konti ir pretrunīgi?	7
Tas notiks. Man ir 36 gadi, un es domāju, ka pagājušajā gadā es beidzot to atradu 🤞	4
Jūsu gudri formulētais atspēkojums visai pārējai kristīgajai pasaulei ir mani pilnībā satricinājis, Roma ir vienīgās īstās mājas! Urrā! Urrā!	13
Es domāju, ka viņš domā, ka viņš bija ļoti skaists bērns, lai pēc pubertātes kļūtu savādāks...	0
Šis ir mazliet politisks ieraksts, bet es vienkārši gribēju izkļūt.	27
Viņi mani neredz, bet es viņus neredzu!	27
Viņš ir iestādes miskaste. Es nicinu [NAME].	27
Tie zēni vēl vairāk smaržoja ūdenī ūdenī. Savāc tos sasodīti punktus, zēni!	2
Sociālo tīklu trūkums man ir liela svētība, tomēr ir dīvaini, ka viņš sūtīja ziņu tavai mammai! Varu derēt, ka viņai patika dzirdēt no viņa!	11,18
Cerēsim, ka janvāris pret mums izturēsies nedaudz labāk nekā decembris.	20
Mans dievs, [NAME] dēļ viņi izmantoja OFICIĀLĀS. Sasodīti dzīvnieki.	2
Šaujamieroču 2. noteikums: Nekad nevērsiet purnu pret kaut ko, ja vien neesat gatavs tajā izdurt sīkus caurumus.	5,20
Liels paldies sirsnīgajam kungam, tagad ar prieku sāku lasīt LN!	15
2 minūte [NAME] ir biedējošākā [NAME]. Baidos, ka viņi, tāpat kā regulārās sezonas spēlē, atkal ir guvuši vārtus pārāk ātri.	14
Liels paldies, tas ir skaisti	0,15
Paldies! Tagad esmu diezgan sajūsmā. Ja vien, protams, viņi visi nenolemj pāriet tieši no Četsvudas uz Gordonu.	13,15
Ceru, ka jūs neesat [RELIGION], jo tas nav košera...	20
Tu tiešām neko nesaproti, mans vīrietis, vai ne? Dievs žēlīgs stulbuma daudzums.	2
Bet viņš joprojām ir manī iemīlējies tikai ne tik stipri kā agrāk... un viņš man zvana.	18
Kad pirmo reizi to dzirdēju, domāju, ka tas ir StuPOTity...	27
Tas ir beidzies! Dodieties tālāk un atrodiet labāku partneri.	5
Lol, viens no viņiem mani iebļāva kautiņā ar nacistiem	1
Tie sūdi mani aizsūtīja lasīšanas ceļojumā.	2
Jūsu komentāri ir noņemti. Šī ir kopiena atbalstam. Atkārtota pārkāpuma gadījumā tiks piemērots aizliegums. Paldies par sapratni.	27
Tātad raksts ir diezgan muļķīgs.	3,11
Dalasā ir diezgan daudz šausmīgu augstceltņu. Bet arī dažas skaistas un ikoniskas.	27
17.5 i pm ko es saņēmu 18	27
Izklausās dīvaini, bet nevajag norīt	26
Tas ir absolūti skaisti	0
Tas ir vēl sliktāk. No viņiem nav jāmaksā nodokļi, un mēs viņiem sniedzam pakalpojumus.	11
Nāc tiešām. Es esmu par geju tiesībām.	4
Svētā ēsma, [NAME]. Man ļoti žēl, ka tam ir jābūt neticami saspringtam, lai būtu blakus un ar to tiktu galā.	19,24,25
[NAME] vajadzēja atgriezties. Esmu pārsteigts, ka jūs varētu kļūt sliktāks par s10, bet es kļūdījos.	26
Hahaha pa īstam..	1
Ir tik dīvaini, ka HG tiek pacelts tik agri, bet man patīk kaut ko skatīties pirms pulksten 8:00 lekcijas sākuma.	3
Es gribu zināt, kā viņa domā, ka jūs varat pārvērst taukus muskuļos	7,8
Esmu sieviete, 50 gadu veca un vergu pēctece. Man garšo asa mērce, bet es ienīstu [NAME].	18
Jūs esat naivs, ja domājat, ka viņi to kaut kā nākotnē neizlīdzinās.	27
Pareizi, jūs ēdat, lai izdzīvotu, bet jūs ēdat dzīvniekus sava prieka pēc.	27
Es viņu apskāvu un pateicu, cik ļoti priecājos, ka pēc policijas uzbrukuma viņam viss ir kārtībā. Viņš ir pārsteidzošs!	0,5
Protams, tie visi ir sazvērestības teorijas sūdi, BET tas, ka viņš tika izspiests, nenozīmē, ka viņi vēlas, lai viņš spēlē konkurējošā komandā.	3
Tu esi smuks!	0
Tāds iespaids man ir radies vienmēr, taču īpašnieks kļūst smeldzīgs, ja nepiekrītat savam atsauksmei!	27
Es augstu vērtēju [NAME] niršanu par to, taču, tā kā viņš to izdarīja, tas noveda pie plaši atvērtas Korver 3. pārejas. Apmēram tikpat automātiska, cik vien iespējams.	27
pagaidiet, viņi faktiski zaudēja lmao. es pārtraucu skatīties pusceļā, jo man šķita, ka SPY tas bija somā ^^^^andigotmywatchrewards	1
Labākais jūs esat [NAME]!!	27
Mana vienīgā kritika ir xhaka, pārāk lēna bumba ieslēgšana un izslēgšana.	10,27
Tāda ir pilnvaru augstā dzīve.	21,27
Nekad neļaujiet faktiem traucēt labam stāstam.	27
jūtos tā, it kā es neesmu normāla un ka esmu apkaunojoša un nepareiza, un citi cilvēki, kas man saka šīs lietas, ir tas, kas ar mani to ir nodarījis	12
Es pavadīju lielu daļu savas bērnības Arizonā un Kolorādo. Man patīk lietus un zaļumi šeit, Oregonā	18
Hip hops ir samazinājies līdz šim mūzika kopumā, kopš 90. gadiem.	9
kāpēc ir grūti noticēt, ka tas ir pilnīgi ticami	6
Ja tikai viņi vairāk atgādinātu [RELIĢIJAS] amirītus?	27
Iespējams, kad viņi pirms dažiem mēnešiem atlaida savu karikatūristu par nepareizu viedokli.	10
Patiešām nezinu, kā tas ir jūsu līdzņemšanai.	10
Šeit [NAME] aizdevums kļūst par sliktu ideju. Es zinu, ka viņš nesāktu, bet tagad nav rezerves RB.	27
Tātad, mēs tagad steidzamies, piemēram, troļļu fermā, lai izveidotu FUD un palielinātu piemaksu pasūtījumu grāmatā. ES to zināju.	27
Kādu veidu jūs klasificētu House no House MD? (TV RAIDĪJUMS, BET OK	27
Histēriski!!!!	27
Viņš nav mans tips, bet [NAME] ir izskatīgs AF. /s	0
Ja viņi vēlas uzbrukt [RELIĢIJAI], viņiem jābūt godīgiem ar vietnes nosaukumu Iedomājieties [RELIGION], kas izveido vietni un nosauc to par Vikikristietību, un pastāvīgi jāuzbrūk [RELIĢIJAI].	3
Interesanti vai ne?	7
Šī viennozīmīgi ir pasaules bīstamākā banda	14
[NAME] IESRAUJIET RIPU *UN* MĒS IEVEIDAM VĀRTUS Kuram gan būtu	4
Es kādreiz pazinu kādu puisi HS un koledžā. Ikvienu viņa ģimenes vīrieti, izņemot viņu, bija iespēris zibens.	27
Ak! Paldies par paskaidrojumu. Visu laiku es domāju, ka to ir rakstījis bērns saviem vecākiem. Es esmu resna.	15,22
Izskatās, ka šiem puišiem tika pārdoti Brexit meli	27
Mēs to nevaram iegūt	10,27
Nekas īpašs, vienkārši patīk laba cīņa ar nazi. Bonuss Revive.	18
Tik un tā parlamentārās sistēmās nav tādas pašas varas dalīšanas. Bet tā ir Bavārijas izpildvara, nevis federālā izpildvara, kas viņiem nosaka, kā balsot.	27

Man skan kā filmas scenārijs.	27

Jums abiem kopā? Sasodītā kompānija, kuru tu izmanto.	2
Tā ir tā frekvence, kas mirst jūsu ausīs. Izbaudiet to, jo jūs nekad vairs nedzirdēsit tieši tādu frekvenci	17
Kuram tas interesē? 2019. gada sezona pat nav sākusies	7
Es nekad neko neesmu teicis par to lmao	1
Šautriņu dēļa trūkums.	27
Noteikti ceru, draugs. Noteikti ceru.	20
Es nedomāju, ka jums ir atļauts ievadīt vakcīnu kādam, kurš ir slims/ievainots.	25
Atvainojiet par vakardienas zaudējumu. Jūsu komanda ir gatava nākamajos gados strādāt vēl labāk, un, cerams, tā arī veiksies.	20
Noteikti nē haha	27

lūdzu, ziņojiet policijai par fizisko un emocionālo vardarbību, lai par to būtu reģistrs. Un pēc iespējas ātrāk meklējiet advokātu.	27
Man ir žēl cilvēku, kuri domā, ka Reddit (vai pat kāds nejaušs sub-reddits) ir &quot;starptautisks posms&quot;.	25

Es domāju, ka gadi...es neesmu gatava un es to zinu, bet es zinu gadus	10
es jūtos sabiedrības nodots	9
Grūti izteikt niansētu viedokli, vai ne? Bet man nepatīk viss, ko viņš dara. Šis ir viens, ja viņi.	2
Akcijām ir mazāka tirgus berze... ir arī lielāks haoss, jo to cilvēku skaits, kas sacenšas, lai nopelnītu tur, salīdzinot ar šeit.	6
Vienkārši runājiet ar Šefīldas akcentu	27
Tu tikko izteici manu domu, riebīgais vaimanātājs	9
Oj.. :(	27
izklausās, ka jūs esat vīrietis, kuram nepatīk sieviešu seksualitāte.	27
Šī bija mana lielākā problēma. Un es arī gribētu nosnausties. Tāpēc man naktī jāmazgājas dušā.	8

Tas bija ļoti noderīgi, liels paldies!	15
Automātiskā spēle patiešām ir nepatīkama, bet seksuālā izglītība bija patiešām labs šovs. Es visu izmēģināju divās dienās.	27

Jā, tas pūķis ar tādu pašu stilu? Hipnotizējoši. Es uzskatu, ka viens ir arī netālu no Civic centra	4
Īpaši nedzeru vispār, jo nākamā diena ir milzīgais šausmas.	14
Kas? Es neko nesapratu no tava teiktā.	6
[NAME] labāk apskatīt grīdu šodien	27
Es redzēju šo komentāru un prātoju, vai kāds grasās to ievietot šeit. Es gandrīz jūtos slikti. Varbūt viņi ir vientuļi.	26
Padevīgs? &quot;viņa ir [NAME], tāpēc burtiski tas ir tā, it kā mani ir svētījusi pilnīgi jauna automašīna [NAME].&quot; Tu esi pretīgs.	11
Attaisnots vai nē, viņš, iespējams, dosies pirms [NAME]	27
Viņš meklē izdales materiālu par 3 bezmaksas ēdienreizēm dienā, izglītību un prasmju apmācību, kā arī jumtu virs galvas. Cietums, tas darbojas.	27
Tas puisis, kurš teica, ka ir laba ideja nekad nesmaidīt pret sievietēm, kuras tev patīk? Pass, grāmata bija ļoti pārvērtēta	7,10
Vai šis cilvēks ēd tikai akmeņus? Jo, ja jūs nostādat baktērijas un cilvēkus līdzvērtīgā stāvoklī, visi ir sasodīti kanibāli.	27
Viņa lasa Kanādas izdošanas aktu, bet ne Kanādas izdošanas līgumu ar ASV. Man jau ir bijis šis strīds, tas ir bezjēdzīgi.	2,27
Man ir 17 gadus vecs draugs, kurš vienkārši meklē &quot;mēmes&quot;, lai noskaidrotu viņa labojumu	27

Man tik ļoti gribas, ka sāp. Laikam man vienkārši ir bail.	14
Es nekad neesmu teicis, ka viņa nav pazemināta. Taču r/political_revolution sūdzība ir tāda, ka viņa 2016. gadā nevienu neatbalstīja.	3,10
Viņa mīļākais bija tikai tas, ka viņš var nosaukt Maccathy, Kingsbury vai Caldwell. [NAME] varēja izvēlēties.	27
Žokejs ir pārsteidzošs, es nezinu, par ko jūs runājat.	6
Jāceļ šī pašcieņa.	27
Tas ir pārsteidzoši, cik buggy ir šī spēle. Tā [NAME] pērk jaunu automašīnu, kurai vairums detaļu ir salūzušas. Galu galā mēs to salabosim.	0
Jā. Es saku, ka kopš Diablo 3 tika parādīts, ka uzņēmuma vairs nav. Viņi vairs nebija spēlētāji, kas veidoja spēles spēlētājiem.	27

Palīdziet, man ir bail un gribas atgriezties.	14

Prieks par jūsu stingro nostāju un palīdzēt viņam izkļūt no jūsu dzīves.	17

Mēģināts pirms gadiem. Bloķējuši greizi politiķi gultā ar InBev un lielu alu. Bruto.	27
Vismaz londonas fani saņēmuši zināmā mērā aizraujošu spēli	13
JUMS JĀIZVEIC PAPILDU PILONI	27
Tas man atgādina to, kad iznāca, ka Hello Kitty! varonis patiesībā ir cilvēka meitene.	27
Tas izklausās kā saprātīgs aprēķins. Ko tad TU darīsi? Jo jūs nevarat piespiest viņus izturēties pret jums kā pret īstiem cilvēkiem.	7
Es tevi saprotu, vīrietis. Tas notiek ar labākajiem no mums.	4
Vienkārši jāievaino vēl 3	27
glīti, paldies!	15
Lol atrada kakla bārdu	1
Ak? Vai debesīs ir finansiālas problēmas? Lol	1
Ak tu!	27
Es uzskatu, ka tās ir 3 vizītkartes un viena uzlīme nevainojamai darbībai. Izņemot to, nē (ja vien nevēlaties ņemt vērā lepošanos).	27
Kā būtu ar negatīvu balsojumu par atjauninājumu?	7,27
Ak, kā viņš vienkārši nosvieda kaķi malā, ooo	26
Paldies par to, ieguvu draugu Vācijā.	15
Varēju aiziet uz ballīti, bet ārā ir 10. Iesūdzi mani.	9
Pārsvarā tādu nav. Daba tikai atrada veidu, kā veicināt uzvedību, kas noved pie mazuļiem jeb seksa.	27
Es gribēju jautāt, kāda temperatūra ir jūsu dzīvesvietā. Skaistums, ja ziemā tiek zaudēts ledusskapis, ir lieliska atpūta brīvā dabā.	0,4
Jā, viņa bija, bet es tagad esmu šeit.	4,27
Turpini...	27
Tās ir burtiski vienīgās iespējas.	27
Malhama Tactical tika atklāta kā viltus FYI	27
Vai varat saistīt atvainošanos? Vai arī tie patiesībā neeksistē?	6,7
Es neesmu pārliecināts, ka miljardu zaudēšana tirdzniecībā ir citu interesēs, izņemot politiskos dedzīgos.	6
Es vienmēr tā plānoju, taču manai sievai parasti ir citas idejas.	27
Tas, kā viņš un viņa mamma runā viens ar otru, ir kā mazs zēns un viņa mamma!	0,1

ANO ziņojumā teikts, ka iedzīvotāji pirms kara: 300 000 [NAME] iedzīvotāju pirms kara: 2 000 000	27

Nomierinies, dickwad	27
Tiekoties pēc šī nīstākā titula ar stulbām ziņām no viņa &quot;fani&quot;	3
Nav pārliecinošu pierādījumu, kas apstiprinātu šo nostāju.	27
LOOOOOL, tikai atmaskoju vīrieti! Arī priecīgu kūku dienu	1
Tas pats. Jūs visi centāties mani glābt, bet es skatījos vēlreiz ar ieslēgtu skaņu un... Es nožēloju.	24
Tu liki man raudāt. Tā notiek reti, tā ir kā dzeja. Kāds mani saņem. Kāds jūt manas sāpes. Paldies.	15,25

Vienu reizi lolojumdzīvnieku preču veikalā redzēju kaķu zāli bez lipekļa. Nezināju, ka tā ir lieta	27
Jā! Šie cilvēki drīkst balsot un braukt un darīt citas lietas, kas ietekmē mūsu dzīvi!	4
Es biju bijībā visu stundu, ko pavadīju tur.	14
Pašreizējā situācija ir savdabīga, tā nepārstāv dažus tirgus, kuriem ir citi instrumenti, lai risinātu šādas lietas.	4,27
Mēs dzīvojam pavisam citā pasaulē nekā tagadējie 70. un 80. gadi	27
Redziet, tā es izdomāju, bet tajā pašā laikā akadēmija ir tāds traucēklis 😂	22,25
Tāpat man patīk spēles, tāpēc tas palīdz mani nomierināt, novēršot domas.	18
Pēc tam es dziedāšu &quot;The Hills are alive with the sound of music.&quot;	27
Lielākā daļa izvarotāju diemžēl nav.	27
Ak, [NAME] un atkal viņa nejaušās muļķības...	27
Viss, kas minēts tālāk, kā arī tas, kad [NAME] gudrais Walmart notiesātais draugs nomainīja [NAME] autiņbiksītes. [NAME] to uzzināja un sāka ballistisko, un tas ir pamatoti.	27
Hah hah Es sapratu, ka citāts viņu ņirgāja — tas bija tik ideāls, ka man likās, ka tas ir īsts. Kvalitatīvs darbs :D	0,1
Tā bija mana kāzu dziesma!	27
Nē, darbojas labi. Tikko bija tur.	27
Pietika ar šīs dzīves un tā visa izbeigšanu.	3
Tas bija visievērojamākais, cik plūstošas bija viņas sarunas, bez kautrības.	27
Jūs varat vienkārši doties uz viņu subreddit, un tur ir daudz lietu, ko cilvēki saka, ko mēs esam teikuši visus šos gadus.	27
Pie velna, es saņēmu 420 pozitīvu balsojumu	13
29 un 39. Pārāk ilgi nesanāca tikties ar tēva vecākiem. Es noteikti saņēmu savu stāvokli no sava Tēva.	27
Tas bija rediģēšanas draugs — viņi ir viens un tas pats bērns. Šī gifa veidošanā neviens bērns nav cietis.	27
Tas ir Visums, kas mēģina mūs nogalināt ar radiāciju :D	10
[NAME] atbilst 3 atsevišķām bērēm, kā arī gandrīz katra ļoti nopietna, neērta saruna, kas man jebkad bijusi, liecina, ka jūs neesat viens. [NAME].	5
&gt; Egalitārisms Es vienmēr uzskatīju, ka feministe joprojām var būt rasiste...	27
Tātad tagad es nevaru aizstāvēties, kad tu esi aizskarošs? lol	1
garākā nedēļa (2014) Es nezinu, vai tā joprojām ir pieejama, bet tā bija diezgan laba romantiska komēdija	4
Forši! Prieks redzēt kādu sadarbību.	17
Sapratu! Paldies!	15
Apsveicu. Jūs ievietojāt slaveno pirmo lolcat attēlu.	0
Op burtiski uzskaitīja OS prasības. Tās ir diezgan pašreizējās darbības (pēdējās paaudzes vairāk vai mazāk) sistēmas, vai ne?	27
Visi šajā video ir kaitinoši. Šķiet, ka šī ir šausmīga vieta, kur pavadīt laiku.	3
Es grasījos paskaidrot, ka tas, kuram ir 8 h, tika uzņemts, līdz es izlasīju jūsu lietotājvārdu. Skaists.	0
kas ir alts?	7,27
Kāpēc kāds ir pārsteigts. Tas nekad nav strādājis.	6
Vai viens ritināmais kanāls? Kad jūs nejauši novērsīsit skatienu un palaidāt garām to, ko gaidījāt, un jums atkal jāsēž cauri visam	27
Mīļš paldies! Atjaunināšu savu CV!	15
Neuzsver to. Veiksmi!	15
Aww man tas ir sūdīgi, bet viņš vismaz dodas uz Eiropu, tāpēc es priecājos par viņu! Uz redzēšanos [NAME]!	0
Vai tas ir akcentu dēļ, kas, jūsuprāt, ir vienādi?	7
Nē, man bija forši senos laikos būt par pedo, pajautājiet [NAME]	27
&gt; Cilvēki ir empātiski un dara to katru dienu. Man tas dažreiz sev jāatgādina.	3,27
Es esmu dāma, tāpēc tas, iespējams, viņus vienkārši satrauktu. Ak, Reddit. Visi ir vīrieši haha.	1
Nē. Tu neesi vienīgais.	27
Jums vienkārši ir maz ticības. Viņiem vajadzēs vairāk naudas, un varbūt tad mēs varam nokļūt Taiti.	20
Paldies jums un jūsu atbalstītājiem	15

Manuprāt, nekad nevajadzēja būt kanoniskajam tēlam... Varbūt paturēt to noslēpumā būtu LABĀK!	4

Es tomēr gribu mainīties. Ja esmu šo cilvēku tuvumā, es palikšu tāds pats. Pa labi?	20
Šī ir vienīgā dzīvotspējīgā izeja no Brexit.	4
Es dzirdu, ka, ja jūs sakāt, ka kaut ko nedarāt, tad, kad jūs to darāt, jūs to faktiski nedarāt.	27
Uh... šausmīgi.	3,11
Es īsi sadusmojos, izveidoju ziņu un ātri tiku tam pāri. Paldies ārstam par diagnozi. 😆	2,15
Gandrīz katrā filmā vai TV šovā varat atrast kaut ko seksistisku vai rasistisku vai kādu grupu nievājošu.	27
ASV komanda gatavojas uzvarēt	27
Paldies. Novērtējiet šo perspektīvu. Es to saku tikai kā pretstatu &quot;virve ir vienīgā cope&quot; mentalitātei incel subreddit.	15
Jūs nevarat apturēt [NAME], jūs varat tikai cerēt, ka viņu savaldīsit	20
Tas lika man izliet dzērienu.	11
Ir daudz stāstu par dzīvniekiem, kuri rūpējas par bērniem... Es ticu stāstam! :)	4
Es to saprotu. Mans jautājums vairāk ir par to, vai kāds būtu par to sajūsmā vai būtu ieinteresēts palīdzēt	8,13
Paldies, es to ienīstu	2,15
Ha, tev jābūt Viskonsīnā. Es atceros TYME mašīnas.	27
Kas ir normāli? Tā tam vajadzētu būt....	3
Varbūt šķiršanās ir nedaudz ekstrēma, bet es tiešām nezinu, kā izteikt savas jūtas, un viņa to nesaprot	6
Kāda nozīme ir tam, ka mēs, kā vienmēr, veiksim vēl vienu krūšutēlu pirmās kārtas vidū	27
Uzpūt mani, neprātīgais debīliķis, es biju ārpus valsts.	2
Es domāju, ka tā būs Pelicans pēc [NAME] prombūtnes (atvainojiet Pelicans fani)	27
Jēziņ, es jokoju	1
LOL, paaugstiniet savu dzīvi. Mana dzīve jau ir augstākā līmenī :))	1
Tev taisnība, es pavisam aizmirsu virsrakstu	4
Smh, brāl, tu apgriezi atbildes, man tas ir jāzina!	27
Izklausās, ka viņa varētu būt nomākta. Cilvēkiem, kuriem ir depresija, nepieciešama aprūpe, mīlestība un palīdzība, lai kļūtu labāki, nevis kaunināšana internetā.	5
Tu noteikti izskaties dusmīgs. #būslabi	3
Manā laikā mums pat nebija vajadzīga valoda, lai izdzīvotu! Dzīvnieki vienkārši klaiņoja apkārt, izdodot dažādas skaņas atkarībā no konteksta!	27
Reiz es dzirdēju, ka pūstošais miskastes karkass Panda darbojas arī tad, ja jūs nevarat dabūt rokās svaigu šinšillu	27

ŅEM MANU NAUDU	4,27
Visa NE kultūra ir uzvara par katru cenu. Neesat pārliecināts, kur jūs dzīvojat, bet, ja tas bērns šķūrē sniegu, saki mammai, lai viņš atnes mājās.	27
paldies par atvainošanos	15
Tas notika ar mani Walmart. Es burtiski tur biju 10 minūtes, izmantojot monētu automātu, un tagad manās durvīs ir rata formas iespiedums...	27
Es vienkārši pavadīju visu nedēļu, ložņājot uzsmēķēt un mēģinot ievilkties meiteņu šortos.	27
paldies, piekrītu	4,15
Es jūtu, kā viņa vaigi uzpūšas.	4
Otrais man skan tik ļoti, es reti saprotu, cik maz es uzticos citiem cilvēkiem, lai veiktu kādu uzdevumu lol	22
Spēlētājiem [NAME] un [NAME] bija vienlīdz labas iespējas, kad viņi pirmajā/otrajā periodā atradās vienā līnijā — viņi vienkārši nekonvertēja.	20,27
Tu esi mana puse. Es jūtu simpātijas pret šo apakšgrupu un vēlos, lai tā būtu laba pieredze visiem.	8
Cik tev gadu?	7
Nevar zaudēt, ja nekad nepārstāj pievilināt. Vai vismaz tā man saka jūsu kohortas.	22
SKAM bija lieliski. Es burtiski izdzēru visu S3, tiklīdz vakar vakarā atgriezos mājās.	0
TeamViolet stiprā ģimene!	0
Pusnaktī histēriski smejos Paldies LMAO	1
Jā, godīgi, turklāt šai apakšgrupai ir tendence smagi pārvietoties dažādos virzienos, tāpēc kļūst īpaši grūti noteikt, vai kāds tiešām ir tik tālu aizgājis.	4
Un vienmēr ir tik neērti neveikli, kad kāds tev saka šādus sūdus.	3
Vārds [NAME] nav gluži lirisks ģeniāls komplekts, kas ir īsts: šis stulbums vienkārši nevarēja izdomāt citu atskaņu.	27
Sasodīts, tas ir skumji	9,25
Visi sāka taisīt rimeikus. Šeit ir mana mīļākā Lineage, arī gribu, bet kāpēc? Cilvēki, kuriem patīk šī spēle, arī to spēlēs	18
Haha, šis ir viens no tiem brīžiem, kas liek man skaļi smieties	1
Pavelc uz augšu savas sasodītās bikses, ak dievs	26
Visu laiku sportiskākā spēle [NAME]. Oho	0
Patīk ideja, ka šie putni parādās ģimenes sapulcēs un vemšanas laikā	0
Varbūt tā ir fantāzija..... Man vienkārši liekas, ka daudzu šo pīļu krājumi šobrīd ir ļoti zemi	25
Ak, vai joprojām ir kļūdas? Dīvaini	11
Sasodīts, [NAME] visu laiku atpaliekam tikai 2 soļus. Tas ir tikai laika jautājums, kad viņš gūs lieliskus sitienus.	4
Es cenšos, lai viņi mēģina pateikt, ka esmu viltus, lai gan es mēģinu dažreiz ar viņiem runāt ir sāpīgi	25
Zobi. Es ļoti gribu labus zobus un mani mati ir jauki un viegli kopjami atm	8
Tātad. Jāšanās. Tonis. Kurls.	3
Nu bāc. Es nedomāju, ka kādam tas ir vienalga... vai tā ir kārtība?	3,9
Es zinu, ka tas ir Naitengeils, bet viņš saka uz augšu no 12/350... ya nē, paldies.	27
Paldies [NAME] par RT Audiences rezultātiem! **ĪSTĀ** objektīva kvalitātes metrika kino filmām!	15
Tas nav pasaules uzskats. Tā ir viena nostāja par vienu tēmu.	27
Es nesaprotu, kā viņas mati ir &quot;pārāk gaiši&quot; vai kā tas ietekmē korektoru.	6
Tātad. Tas ir sasodīti biedējoši.	14
Jūs nevarat izvēlēties, kādus gēnus nodot tālāk.	27
Man patīk tavs darbs, tas liek maniem matiem raudāt	18
Ak, puika, vai man tev ir sliktas ziņas!	9
Man patīk, kā viņi īsti nereaģēja negatīvi	0
Un tas smaidiņš, ko viņa iedeva līgavainim, kad viņš apsēdās ar sviestmaizi....man būtu bail, ja es būtu viņš.	14
Mana mamma uzskata, ka šī apkaime ir droša, un es nevēlos, lai viņa būtu paranoiskāka, bet man šķiet, ka man kaut kas jādara.	27
No šī kadra rodas slimīga vidusskolas nostalģija. Paldies tam vīrietim!	15

Kas?! Tagad jūs tikko sasniedzat brāli. Viņš pat nav labākais kultūrists vārdā [NAME], [NAME] liek viņam pārspēt.	26
Tas un [NAME] zaudēšana. Viņiem diviem bija tūlītēja ķīmija. Ar prieku redzu, ka viņš nākamgad var kļūt par lielu daļu no mūsu uzbrukuma.	13,27
Jautājumi ir pietiekami normāli, bet visi uzreiz un vadīt ar tiem ir nedaudz dīvaini.	12
[NAME] bija populārākās mēmes, kad es pirmo reizi sāku lietot Reddit. Godīgi sakot, neviena no mēmu apakšgrupām nav laba, tās visas ir diezgan niecīgas.	12
Es domāju, ka visa kafija jau ir keto....	27

Es nezinu par romantiku, bet es noteikti varu runāt [NAME] vārdā.	4
Omg tu esi tik mīļš!	0
Jā, ja jūs spējat to izpildīt. Cerams, ka bonuss ir tā vērts	4,20

Tas ir ļoti slikti, ka jūs domājat, ka palīdzēt mazāk laimīgajiem ir skumji, un par to jokojat. Tādi cilvēki kā jūs ir problēma.	3
Mana kaķene tikko ļoti priecājās, kad Pasta guva vārtus. Tik skaļi murrājumi! Es arī biju laimīga.	17

neesmu pārliecināts, ka piekrītu. neprāta čuksti var iestatīt [NAME] parakstu, un kāršu izloze vienmēr ir noderīga pirmajā joslā.	4
Es tiešām jutu, ka mans bumbiņu maiss mazliet uzlēca, kad viņš seja stādīja	27
Ziema šeit pat nav tik slikta.	27
Es domāju, ka šī ir vienīgā vieta internetā, kas ir apmierināta ar šo reklāmu hahaha	1
Šis. Mums jau ir daudz vairāk OL talantu. Mums vajag vēl vienu WR un TE, bet es esmu sajūsmā	13

Izskatās, ka viņas seja ir atvilkta ar &#39;&#39;face lifting&#39;&#39; lenti. Vai arī tā, it kā viņa atvelk seju, piemēram, MIB I ainā.	27
Tas nav iegrimt. Es gandrīz nerunāju mīklas. Veiksmi	5

Jā, un man tas ļoti patīk 😂😂	18

Man ir maniem bērniem signāls baño — burts T ASL valodā, lai viņi netraucētu nodarbībai, jautājot.	27
Kā tas koku izņēma!!	27
Kauns, tu esi diezgan mīļš	0
Es smejos, jo tieši tas notika ar mani.	1
Jā, es domāju, ka esmu par to. Tāpēc paldies par to (?)	15
Ikvienam var būt grūti darīt kaut ko, kas jums nepatīk, taču, ja paturat prātā savus gala rezultātus, jūs varat darīt jebko!	4
VAI TAS IR DZĪVES METAPORS?	7
Vai vienkārši ej ārā un nekad neatskaties.	2
varbūt tagad uzkāps līdz 3 stundā😎	27
[NAME] ir tāda dāvana. ES mīlu viņu.	18
Esmu ļoti sajūsmā un gaidu, kad tiešraides serverī tiks ievietots FOV slīdnis.	13
Es dzirdēju, ka tas ir saistīts ar Floridas noziegumu ziņošanas likumiem — tas ir, tas pats varētu notikt citur, bet tas neveidotos presē?	6,7
Reiz nejauši ierados šeit, ieraudzīju tavu atzinību un tagad, pēc 2 nedēļām, pilnībā saprotu.	27
Kad cilvēki ir nedroši, viņiem labāk patīk kāds, kurš ir spēcīgs un nepareizs, nevis kāds, kurš ir vājš un pareizs, - [NAME]	27
Viņas mazais mazulis saraucis pieri ir burvīgs	0
Šī... es nedomāju, ka šī ir Ohaio...	6
Ak, paskaties, tās ir mazas futbola bumbas!	27
Labi, man godīgi interesē, kāpēc jūs tā domājat?	7
Tas tiešām ir interesanti. Paldies par informāciju. Ir vienkārši grūti iedomāties dzīvi, kuru jūs nekad nedzīvosit.	13,15
Taisnība! Es domāju, ka mēs visi priecājamies par sāls ezeru? Tā kā viņi ir tieši saistīti ar mums.	4
piekritu 100%, ja tas ir smieklīgi! Es domāju, ka YouTube viņiem maksā, lai ietekmētu jūs maksāt par You Tube abonementu, lai tikai NEskatītu šīs reklāmas!	4
Shhh, lai viņiem tas ir, viņiem tas ir vajadzīgs. Viņi joprojām dzīvo 1990. gadā, lol	1
Tas ir pretīgi.... lūdzu, izveidojiet vairāk.	11
viņa arī turpina apgalvot, ka viņas atmiņa sākās 10 mēnešu vecumā	27
pēc tam esam pelnījuši zaudēt	9
Es esmu Telts	27
Sasodīts. Lieliski arī upuriem un citiem, kas runāja par vardarbību.	0
Man būs viens, lūdzu, no katra. Ne tikai galēji pa kreisi un pa labi. Visi. Jebkuri dubultspēles, kas jums varētu būt arī. Paldies byeee	15
Tiešām? Kā viņi var zināt, kuru aptieku vēlaties apmeklēt?	7
atvainojiet ko. [NAME] gandrīz visu pagājušās sezonas pusi Liverpūles rindās spēlēja vidējā līnijā	0
Viņai labāk!!! .....neviens cits to nedarīs	0
Tas man arī liek raudāt! bet tāpēc, ka tas parāda, cik tālu [NAME] ir kritis...	25
Paredzēts kā &quot;tas ir smieklīgi, jo tā ir patiesība&quot;, nevis &quot;tas ir smieklīgi&quot;	1
Concas! Vic parkā. Vairākas reizes slēgts veselības un drošības pārkāpumu dēļ lol	27
Šis sitiens ir neprātīgi gluds	0
Tbh, es domāju, ka apakšgrupa tika izveidota tāpēc, ka viņi šeit ieviesās strīdos.	27
Es lepojos, ka esmu rasists Neviens dzīvē to neuzzinās	21
Man šķiet, ka jums ir jāizkļūst no pašreizējās situācijas savas laimes dēļ.	5
Viņi jūs izkrāpa, tērējot jūsu laiku	27
kāpēc tu pēkšņi esi detektīvs	6
Sveiki, šī ir ISIS. Jā, mēs to izdarījām.	27
Iedzeršana šobrīd VN ir liela problēma, diemžēl. Tāpēc es nebrīnītos, ja galvenais iemesls tam būtu dzērums.	4,9
Muddy Rudder svētdienas vakaros skan īru mūzika.	27
Jūs esat novirzījis vārtu stabus no pirmā romāna uz pirmo mūsdienu romānu... Jūs, cilvēki, vienmēr sūdzaties, ka inceli nesniedz nekādu atbalstu viņu apgalvojumiem.	27
jā, viņi kļūdās bez iemesla, es tikai saku, labs darbs, tā turpināt.	0,15,20
Un publiski apgalvoja, ka sita [NAME].	27
Piezīme sev – nepalieciet ārpus ūdens.	27
Šīs stila ādas man tik ļoti atgādina dobu bruņinieku	27
Ak dievs, viens kopsaucējs atkal uzbrūk un berzē pārējos spēlētājus. Mēs esam lemti, atgriezieties pie rasēšanas dēļa 2020. gadā	9
kad [NAME] raud uz Vidēju	27
Aplūkojot jautājumus, uz kuriem tika atbildēts AMA pēc aplādes [NAME], es neredzu nevienu, kas būtu saistīts ar [NAME] vai rasi/IQ.	10
Cerams, ka drīz varēsim to atrisināt.	8,20
Vai tas bija drošības spilvens jūsu kāju/pēdu zonā?	7
Tas lika man izspļaut kafiju. Bet es uzskatu, ka [NAME] ir pārāk karalisks. Kā ar [NAME]?	7
Esmu pārsteigts par to, cik ātri viņi varēja iegūt grafiku Kentam.	26
Es tam nepiekrītu, jūs nevarat teikt, ka visi valstī tā dara, jūs nezināt katru [NAME] un visu viņu dzīvesstāstus	10
Galvenokārt tāpēc, ka viņi nav pilnīgi stulbi. Viņiem nav atbalsta Senātā, lai to izvilktu.	10
Pareizi! Diemžēl mēs meklējam mazliet vairāk skaitļošanas pieredzes, nekā tikai zināt, kurā vietnē atrodaties. Tomēr paldies par jūsu interesi.	15
Atdzesē. Ne visi ir ideāli.	4
Es nedomāju, ka pretendentos var atrast labāku atbalsta līniju par signalizāciju un aļņiem. pilnīgi ārprātīgs un sajūgs tas ir neticami	26
Labi, ka aizvērāt durvis! Jūs neesat par viņu atbildīgs. Viņš ir pieaudzis cilvēks, kurš ir pieļāvis savas kļūdas.	2
Es vienmēr smejos par iepriekš minēto apgalvojumu. &quot;Vai esat kvalificēts, lai dotu urīna paraugu?&quot; &quot;Hu?&quot;	1
Kāds ir tavs labākais [NAME] stāsts? Tu roki btw!	0
Ja [NAME] par viņu rūpējās, kāpēc viņš ļāva viņam iekļūt negadījumā? Domāju, ka viņš nepievērsa uzmanību.	27
Limiti... balso par.	27
Nevienu neinteresē, ja viņš tiek bloķēts. Satraukums pret jums ir smieklīgs	1,17
Es nevaru pateikt, vai šīs ir laimīgas vai skumjas beigas. 😐	6
esmu tik lepns par tevi!! labs darbs čalis!! :)	0,21
Es teiktu, ka galvenā atšķirība, iespējams, ir vegemītu patēriņš...	4,27
Man pietrūkst konfeti kūkas :(	25
Tā ir slēpta mlm, kas izveidota, lai piesaistītu koledžas demogrāfiskos datus. Es tiku ārā	2,3
MĪLU ŠO!!	0
Jūs varat doties uz oficiālo līgas forumu un meklēt cilvēkus.	4
Jūs nepareizi uzrakstījāt Austrumkrieviju	27
Man tas izskatās pēc grāmatu plaukta	27
Un es nevaru piezvanīt uz galvaspilsētas sadales skapi, lai izteiktu savas bažas par to, jo valdība ir slēgta. Satriecošs.	0
Tikai labas.	27
Nu, tas ir skatiens.	4
Nē, meitiņ, tev izdevās lieliski. Mani šokē arī puiši, kuri vēlas pieslēgties bez prezervatīva.	0,26
Es vairāk ticu [NAME] nekā jebkuram citam laukumā, lai izveidotu dīvainu pasauli	20
Viņai ir 43 gadi ar 4 bērniem. Tas ir tik tālu aiz sienas, ka tas nav smieklīgi.	27
Ak, jā, romantiskā koncepcija par maltīti gultā.	4
Es neesmu 😀 Priecājos, ka saproti savu kļūdu un to, kāpēc es biju apmulsusi 😉	6,17,22
Tā izklausās pēc labas sistēmas.	0
Tas ir īsts stāsts ar dažām neveiklām dīvainībām, haha	1
Liels OUCHIE!	27
Jūsu mammu nākamos trīs gadsimtus valdīja [NAME] dinastija, kas bija maķedoniete.	27
Augsts IQ amats. Es domāju, ka tas ir tieši tas, kas notiks.	27
&gt; [NAME] Tas kļūs ļoti mulsinoši, ja viņš pievienosies mūsu nodaļai.	6
Man žēl to dzirdēt. Ceru, ka jaunajā gadā izdosies atrast kaut ko, kas iepriecinās.	20,24
Superīgi puiši! Paldies par idejām. Interesanti redzēt, ko cilvēki darīs atkarībā no tā, vai viņi spēlēs slepkavu vai izdzīvojušo lol	0,15
Tas ir interesanti. Vai varat ievietot dažus avotus vai kaut ko par šo jautājumu? Esmu patiesi ieintriģēts.	7
Tiešām? Man nebija ne jausmas, ka biopieejamība ir tāda pati	7,26
Awe man paldies ♥️♥️	0,15
Tātad, vai viņai ir vērts pāriet no Skye	27
Tas ir tik traki, ka sāp. Man ir tik žēl to, kurš to nosūtīja, jo viņi ir tik stulbi.	9,25
Es saprotu tavu domu. Bet es tomēr labprātāk nozagšu kādu mantu, nekā pazaudēju kādu ģimenes locekli.	3
Mana nojausma ir, ka šīs nav pirmās vai pēdējās kāzas, ko šis bārs ir redzējis	27
Paldies! Šķiet, ka [NAME] saprot, cik toksiska var būt arī šī fanu bāze. Tagad cerēsim, ka jūs visi saglabāsit mieru neatkarīgi no tā, vai 1. nedēļā uzvarēsim vai zaudēsim.	27
Varētu domāt, bet cilvēkiem ir dota liela rīcības brīvība. Pie velna, dienvidos valsts skolās ir atļauts pērt bērnus.	27
Kādam iekšējām personām ir tikai 250 sekotāju?	7,27
Kaitinoši, vai ne! Paldies, laikam arī man būs jābeidz atbildēt!	3,15
Priecājos, ka tev iet labāk, interneta svešinieks, un es ceru, ka turpināsi zināt mieru un laimi. Esi vesels.	17,20
Acīmredzot mans stāvoklis 😔	27
Jums ir taisnība, paldies, ka norādījāt uz to, tagad esmu to rediģējis. Turpiniet.	4,15
Ak noteikti. Dažreiz es prātoju, vai viņi patiešām nodara kaitējumu ar pārmērīgu liekulību, šķiet, ka jaunpienācēji to diezgan ātri redz.	26
Tikai nešķērsojiet Tīģerus, hmmmm?	27
Fantastisks krogs, tur devos pagājušajā gadā šķidrās vēstures krogu tūres ietvaros.	0
32.? Likās kā 99. vai kaut kas...	6,7
Tu viņu dabū nost 3 reizes un viņa tevi nepabeidz? Tas šķiet ļoti savtīgi.	27
Arī šeit, Amerikā. Tie, kas protestē pret fašistiem, tiek ieslodzīti cietumā un tiek apsmidzināti kā dzīvnieki. Nav jēgas, ka tas notiek.	2,3,10
Nosvīdusi mazā incel jaunava	27
Sapratu. Es biju precējies dažus gadus pirms tam, bet jūs, iespējams, pazīstat manu māsu. Viņa satikās ar puisi jūsu filiālē vārdā [NAME]	27
Tad ēdienam jābūt labam. Tas izskatās labi. Bez koka dēļa lol	0,1
TAMĀRS ĪPAŠI!!!	27
Mazliet mazāk kaitinātu, ja tie 10 centi, ko maksā, ja gribi kādus papīra maisiņus, nenonāktu valdībai kā nodoklis.	3,27
Man ir mazliet skumji, ka patiesībā nav video ar nosaukumu Dance of the Hillary, vīruss vai nē.	25
Nīstošajai Big Pharma nav nekāda sakara ar anti-vax.	10
Labi, šī ir patiešām daudzsološa lieta. Es noteikti par to esmu sajūsmā.	13,20
Pagalma kazas bija lieliskas. Gandrīz lielākās līgas sajūta, kad ir pārpildīta diena	0
Viņš neapzinās, ka viņa sit ukuleles puisi.	27
[NAME] mēmie draugi gribēja viņu kopā ar mazo ļaundari. un tagad viņš nonāks atpakaļ cietumā. Ak, [NAME], es mīlu [NAME].	18
Tātad cilvēki viņu atbalstīs šajā viltus ziņu ātrās reaģēšanas politiskajā vidē	27
&gt; Tev tās nepieder, lai tev dotu olas, tu tās saglabāji un tagad nejauši viņi tev dod olas. Šis!	27
Vai tas idiots neapzinās, ka apgrauzdē sevi, nosaucot [NAME] par sliktu advokātu? Tu strādāji ar viņu desmit gadus, debīli.	3
Ielieciet mērci savā sēžamvietā. Labāka buzz un bez riska zaudēt žokli	27
Paldies par dalīšanos. Šādi meli apgrūtina patieso melu dalīšanu un taisnīguma gūšanu	15
Šķiet, ka ir īstais brīdis pajautāt, kādas ir superrobotu lietas, ko pārbaudīt? Es jebkad esmu redzējis tikai Gurrenu.	7
Dariet to, kas ir jūsu lietotājvārds. Tie nav salīdzināmi ir mazākais.	27
Viņš jaucas ar manām emocijām un manu fantāzijas hokeja baseinu...	3
Nezināja, ka viņam ir arī iniciāļi uz augšstilbu spilventiņiem	22
Tu mani uzvarēji	3,27
Es ceru, ka Īrijas dēļ jums ir taisnība.	20
Vai jūs nevarat pateikt, ka [NAME] ir nopietni draudi aizturēt? Visa šī iespējamā melošana padara viņu par nopietnu apdraudējumu citiem.	10
Tas ir interesants paņēmiens. Paldies, ka devāt man kādu skatījumu, nebiju tādu redzējusi.	7,15
Es jūtos ārkārtīgi slikti par cilvēkiem šajā pavedienā, kuri jebkādā veidā paļaujas uz federālo valdību, lai uzlabotu savu situāciju.	9
Labi, diēta ir svarīga, tā ir taisnība. Vai lietojat kādas zāles? Vai jums ir psihiatrs vai ārsts, pie kura jūs apmeklējat savu garīgo veselību?	4,7
katru reizi kļūst nedaudz slapjš un vējains	27
Lol es lol&#39;d *Es arī esmu lejā ar bērniem. Bet ne tā, jo tas būtu nelikumīgi*	1,3
Tāds neforšs čalis	27
Jūsu veidam, godīgi sakot, jādrāz prom no Īrijas. Neviens nevēlas šeit tavu muļķīgo antisemītismu	3
Alllllllllmooooooooost got ittttttttt.	27
Jebkurā gadījumā dodieties uz to. Mēs visi būsim daudz laimīgāki, ja jūs mūs vairs nevilksiet.	4
Viņa ir jauka abos attēlos, bet kas ir ar trīsstūra zodu kreisajā pusē	0
jūs gatavojaties izstarot	27
Es arī visu laiku tikai stāvēju un aplaudēju.	4
Man bija draugs, kurš man atsūtīja 3+ stundu garu paranojas sazvērestības dokumentālo filmu, man šķiet, ka to sauca... Izniekotas 10 minūtes, pirms es nokūpēju.	2
Ah!! Nebiju gaidījis to izlasīt šorīt, braucot uz darbu un mājām 😭 lol Vienkārši tik skaisti!	0,1,22
Vai ir iespējams, ka esat bijis aizliegts no viņiem? Es nezinu, kā es jūtos par īpašu privilēģiju redzēt šo subtitru. lol.	1
Katolicismā vecais ir labs. Patiesība ar laiku nemainās. Malichi 3:6 &quot;...jo es esmu [NAME], es nemainos&quot;.	0
Noziedzība parkā ir vienīgais nozieguma veids, kam ir nozīme šīs diskusijas dēļ. Jūsu vispārīgums šeit neattiecas.	10
Sieva mani pameta, un es vienkārši esmu salauzta. šovakar recidīvs no 7 gadiem tīras un vienkārši vairs neredz jēgu	25
tas nav par to, lai pieprasītu savu, tas tikai par to, no kurienes tas ir	27
Bagāts ir arī vārds	27
Man tiešām žēl tos nebrīvojošos kubiešu mazuļus. Tas ir vienkārši skumji.	25
Pat sliktāk.	11
Sasodīts, mums vajag veselus PG.	3
Ik es raudu rn	25
Pilnīgi derīgs punkts, taču [NAME] ir labāks nekā jebkurš cits, ar ko [NAME] bija jāstrādā.	0
FWIW šis arī tika ievietots vakar	22
[NAME] to ieguva pirms dažiem mēnešiem. Draugs nopirka dažus savam slimajam sunim.	5
oh c&#39;mon - es vēlos redzēt, kā jūs aizstāvat vecās derības verdzību!	8
To jau teica visi, bet lats un krūtis, kājas ir liela kvadra enerģija. Tā turpināt	0

ES piekrītu! Es viņu mīlēju kā [NAME], un es vēlos, lai rakstīšana būtu labāka. Viņš ir pārsteidzošs.	0,18
Vai ir kāds veids, kā, lūdzu, pārtulkot piezīmes dokumenta formā vai kā? Man ir problēmas tos apskatīt :(	25,27
Kā mēs zinām, ka jūs neesat Mossad aģents? Es domāju, ne šobrīd, bet kā būtu, ja jūs pievienotos nākotnē? /s	27
Liels un gluds kā marmors.	27
RantGrumps īsumā	27
Vai [NAME] tiešām varētu viņu pacelt un nēsāt, nepūšot un nepūstot? 😳😓	27
Mans sapnis ir kādreiz iegūt pilnīgi melnu skapi. Pagaidām esmu iestrēdzis ar drēbēm, kuras man izvēlas mamma.	8
Paskaties, es nesaku, ka piekrītu viņiem, nav vajadzības būt ākstam	2,10
Varbūt jūs vienkārši izbaudāt rakšanas procesu? Vai tam ir jābūt kādam, kas jūs piesaista, vai arī esat mēģinājis vajāt kādu nejaušu cilvēku?	27
Jāmīl šie bērni! Kad viņi dara vai saka visskaistākās lietas, tas patiešām liek jums izkust....... Izbaudiet OP!!!	17,18
Ar nepacietību gaidu, kad šo cilvēku varoņi mirst pēkšņi un ekstravagantā veidā.	27
INTP vai nē, tā ir universālā interešu valoda, vismaz manā grāmatā.	27
Šis... Šeit beidzas mans ceļojums. Es nevarēju tikt līdz galam, lai veicas nākamajiem redditoriem!	9,15
Cilvēki saka: “pārliecība ir pievilcīga”, kas noteikti ir taisnība. Tas nenozīmē, ka būt augstprātīgam vai izlikties par pašpārliecinātu ir pievilcīgi.	4
Lūdzu, uzdodiet jautājumus par pārcelšanos uz Denveru sadaļā Jautājumi un atbildes, paldies! Īsa atbilde: nē	15
Esmu dzirdējusi, cik grūti ir iekļūt māsu programmās, apsveicu!	15
Ja man tā būtu, es beigtu strādāt un ceļotu uz pilnu slodzi. Es nesaprotu turīgo alkatību. Tam nav nekādas jēgas.	9
Es uzticētos kādam, kuram ir saistoši noteikumi attiecībā uz [NAME] no Eseksas, kurš vaino imigrantus, jo viņu atlaida par gulēšanu darbā	27
Man vairāk interesē, kāpēc bildē ir zelta zivtiņas...	13
Es zinu, ka tu joko, bet viņi mūs sagrāva un tomēr izvēlējās labāk. Diezgan klibs.	3
Es nedomāju, ka tas vispār notika tbh	10
Es tiešām tā ceru	20
Ļoti labs padoms, es to nesapratu. Es domāju, ka nomas līgumā ir lielāks risks, nekā es sākotnēji domāju.	5
Jūs domājat, ka cilvēki vēlas mani precēt. Joki ir par jums mājās.	1
Vai jūs vienkārši neienīstat, kad viņi izcērt Sahāras tuksnesi?	27
Pagaidi, ko? Ēzelis atrada stāstu? Vai kāds var man iemācīt, kā izmantot atpakaļceļa mašīnu, lai es varētu to izlasīt?	6
Sīka gara ņurdēja. Hangry nenotiek vēl 6 stundas.	27
Kāpēc [NAME] smaids sākumā ir šī visa labākā daļa?!	7
Pilnībā piekrītu. Kas der vienam, nav vērts citam. Veiksmi.	4
Es nekad pat nezināju, ka skolas nodaļā ir iebiedēšana. Es biju beidzis skolu un lasīju par iebiedēšanu skolā.	22,26
Ak, oi. Es joprojām nepiekrītu, bet es redzu savu kļūdu	10
Viņš ir tāds mazs kucēns, kuram nav iespējams patikt	2,3

Neticami nomākta.	3

Sasodīts, jūs zināt, ka es to izlasīju, un es domāju, ka tas mainījās pareizi, bet es domāju, ka tā nav.	6,22
Nē, tā nav. Ne daudz kā jūsu OP. Jums vienkārši nav nekā ārpus jūsu jūtām.	27
Protams čalis. Lai gan es teiktu, ka mans līmenis dziļas gudrības izplatīšanā ir mazāks par ātrumu, kādā es varu runāt pilnīgi BS haha	1,20,27
Esmu dzirdējis par cilvēkiem, kas to darīja kopmītņu pirmkursa gadā, un kopš tā laika nebiju par to domājis. Cilvēki teica, ka tas strādāja.	4
man tas patīk	18
Neticu, ka es un mana ģimene grasījāmies izbraukt piecas minūtes agrāk, lai pārvarētu satiksmi. Godīgi sakot, labākā spēle, ko esmu redzējis dzīvajā	26
Tagad mums vienkārši jānogalina [NAME], ja [NAME] netika saglabāts, lai patiešām izlīdzinātu izredzes ar viņu, līdzīgi kā [NAME] ar [NAME].	22
Mani piespieda stāties koledžā, un es izniekoju savu GPA :(	9

kā kpop stan un armija, esmu ļoti vīlies	9
Jā, un es nezinu, kāpēc, tas man bija pilnīgi neatbilstošs...	27
kāds psiho	3
Tas būšu es pēc gada. Nepavisam nav godīgi.	10,12

Es labprāt uzspēlētu kādu no šiem diviem!!! Otrā izvēle ir Karakala!	18
Es arī to domāju, tāpēc, iespējams, tomēr iešu ar nosūtījumu. Vēlreiz paldies par palīdzību!	15
Eseja nav obligāta.	27
Mana mamma strādā NASA un acīmredzot nē. Viņi viņiem iedeva brošūras ar kredītaģentūru numuriem un padomus par aizdevumu saņemšanu. Tas ir diezgan šausmīgi.	1,11
Abu šo lietu gaidīšana ir spīdzināšana	27
Vienkārši iekļaujiet [NAME], lai turpinātu mocīt [NAME]	27
Paldies. Arī pēc hospitalizācijas man atklāja 1. asinsspiedienu.	15
